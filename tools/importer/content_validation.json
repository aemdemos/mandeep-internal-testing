Accessible tours Who can book the Easy and Accessible shore excursions? These easy tours are available for all guests and are wheelchair accessible. This program is designed to provide memorable, enjoyable experiences for limited-mobility guests, seniors, and anyone who enjoys a slower pace, as well as their families. How are the Easy & Accessible shore excursions different from other regular shore excursions? Easy & Accessible excursions are unique in that they offer: Completely step-free tour routes Wheelchair Accessible vehicles Shorter distances Slower pace Accessible restrooms with wide doors along the route Professional and compassionate tour guides experienced in working with senior and limited mobility clients What type of vehicles are used for the Easy & Accessible shore excursions? Easy & Accessible shore excursions use accessible vehicles equipped with either a ramp or lift for easy wheelchair access. How can I trust that these tours are fully accessible? Our Easy & Accessible shore experiences have been designed and vetted over many years by world-renowned accessibility experts and by travellers with disabilities. Routes are verified and tested consistently to meet the high standards set by MSC Cruises. How big are the groups for the Easy & Accessible shore excursions? To make these tours more enjoyable, group sizes are smaller than regular tours - these are not large motor coach groups. For most tours, small accessible vans are used. How will the guide assist me with my mobility needs? The tour guides conducting these accessible tours have several years of experience in touring with limited mobility guests and their families. They are patient, compassionate and very knowledgeable. Please note that guides are not permitted to push wheelchairs. Guests in wheelchairs must be able to self-propel or have a companion push them. What can I expect from my Easy & Accessible shore excursions? Accessible shore excursions are authentic experiences, designed to limit the amount of walking, without compromising on the experience. If you are asking yourself: \"Will I get to leave the bus?\", the answer is \"Yes!\". While other tours labelled as \"accessible\" only allow you to see the destination through a bus window, MSC Cruises offers wheelchair accessible shore excursions that include inside visits to castles, churches, museums, palaces, and historic ruins. How do I make sure my mobility equipment isn't too big or too heavy for the excursion? For each Easy & Accessible tour, the maximum combined weight allowed (equipment + mobility user) as well as maximum equipment dimension allowed (height, length, and width) are provided in their tour description notes. Please make sure to carefully check and verify that your equipment respects the dimensions allowed before booking the tour. In which destinations can I book Easy & Accessible shore excursions? Currently, the Easy & Accessible shore excursion program is available throughout several Caribbean ports. You can see a complete list of destinations offering Easy & Accessible tours listed above. When should I book my Easy & Accessible shore excursion? We suggest you book your Easy & Accessible shore excursion at least 2months before your cruise in order to secure your space. Can I cancel my booked Easy & Accessible shore excursion? It is possible to cancel your booked Easy & Accessible tours up to 4 days prior to your cruise departure date. Why is a minimum number of participants required? The minimum number of participants is required to guarantee the tour to run at the individual price displayed on the website. In case the number of participants is not met, guests will be given the choice to book the tour for an additional cost, as a private tour. The individual price will then vary depending on the number of participants. Who can book the Easy and Accessible shore excursions?

Think snow-capped mountains, fjords and otherworldly glaciers, plus grizzlies skulking around forests and channels filled with humpback whales. There are few places in the world like it - it has the biggest concentration of glaciers in North America (nearly 100,000), as well as the highest population of grizzly bears. The state is also widely known for its invaluable Indigenous culture dating back thousands of years - discovering Alaskan Native heritage is a must during any cruise in Alaska, whether that's by visiting museums, watching traditional cultural performances or admiring intricate totem poles. What to do in Alaska? There's truly something for everyone on a cruise through Alaska. History buffs can brush up on the Gold Rush, foodies can sample local specialities (including Inuit ice cream), while those curious about culture can learn about the Indigenous peoples of Alaska and traditions like carving totem poles. Luckily, Ketchikan's Creek Street is a fine place to do all three of these things. Its antique boardwalk has a storied past and is now home to inviting restaurants and shops. Plus, it's also a top vantage point for seeing salmon, as well as being located right by some of the town's beautiful totem poles. See more at Saxman Village's Totem Park, also in Ketchikan. More than anything, though, holidays to Alaska are all about the outdoors. Hiking trails are abundant, though Nugget Falls Trail is an easy and popular route near Juneau that stops at a huge waterfall. There are also thousands of stunning glaciers to visit, with Mendenhall Glacier both one of the most accessible and most beautiful. It's also very likely that your trip will involve at least a handful of exciting wildlife encounters. Sitka, Icy Strait Point, Ketchikan, Tracy Arm fjord and Juneau all offer whale watching tours and chances to see all kinds of bears. It's also entirely possible that you'll spot sea lions, caribou, salmon, otters and bald eagles during your holiday. What other countries are included in a cruise that goes to Alaska? Guests on one of our cruises to Alaska will also get to enjoy the wonders of Canada, as our itineraries end in Victoria, the gorgeous and culture-crammed capital of British Columbia. The rest of the time is spent in the US, with all ships leaving from vibrant Seattle, Washington, before sailing Alaska's Inside Passage. How long are Alaska cruises? Most of our Alaska cruise itineraries last for seven nights. This is a fantastic amount of time to spend enjoying this genuinely magnificent region, as you'll be able to sail the Inside Passage route and visit some of the state's most popular destinations - all at a relaxing pace. Where do Alaska cruises leave from? Seattle is the only embarkation port for our Alaska cruises. As Washington State's largest city, it's got plenty to explore before you leave on your voyage. Take a ride to the top of the Space Needle - the iconic observation tower that dominates the city's skyline - or hop aboard the Seattle Center Monorail. Downtown, spend some time browsing the stalls at the centuries-old Pike Place Market, get cultural at the Seattle Art Museum or cheer on the Seattle Mariners at baseball field T-Mobile Park. Seattle is also the home of Starbucks, and coffee-lovers should absolutely seek out the Starbucks Reserve Roastery for an awakening experience. Little wonder that we decided to start our Alaska cruises from Seattle. What to pack for a cruise to Alaska? Packing for holidays in Alaska can be a breeze - sometimes quite literally. Even though temperatures in spring and summer are thoroughly pleasant, there can also be some wind and rainfall, so you'll need to pack light layers, long-sleeve jumpers and a jacket or two - ideally including a waterproof jacket, just in case. But don't let the mention of waterproofs allow you to forget to bring a sunhat and high-SPF sun cream, too. Good walking shoes or hiking shoes are essential, so that you can get out into the wilderness in comfort. It's also recommended to pack some more formal clothes and shoes for evenings, particularly Gala Night, where passengers love looking their best. However, your most important item to pack for cruises in Alaska will always be a camera, allowing you to capture the breathtaking scenery and the once-in-a-lifetime wildlife encounters that surround you. How much is a cruise to Alaska? No matter what your budget might be, MSC Cruises has an option for you, as you'll see when you take a look at our Alaska cruise deals. Bring that dream trip a little closer and start planning right now - find the best Alaska cruise deals here our website. Which ports do MSC Cruises visit in Alaska? Our Alaska cruises from Seattle call at five different but equally enticing ports in Alaska. Ketchikan is known for its rich Alaska Native culture, including more than 80 totem poles, while Icy Strait Point in Hoonah is great for spotting wildlife and zooming down huge zip-lines. Gaze out at awe-inspiring glaciers and icebergs in Tracy Arm fjord, go hiking or discover local heritage in Sitka, or try whale watching in Alaska's capital, Juneau. All five places are enlightening, must-visit destinations on a holiday to Alaska. What is the weather like in Alaska? It's always important to consider the weather when booking an Alaska cruise. The sunniest and warmest time is from June to August. It's never overly hot, though, with highs between 15\u00b0C and 19\u00b0C. May temperatures are also pleasant - plus, this is often the month with the least rainfall. September is fairly dry as well, but also starts getting a little cooler, with an average high of 13\u00b0C. Outside of these times brings shorter days and extreme cold in some months, demonstrating that the best time for your Alaska cruise is from May to September. When is the best time to cruise Alaska? Our Alaska cruises set sail between May and September, which are the best months to visit this northernmost US state. June, July and August will appeal to many thanks to their warmer temperatures. However, May and September are also fantastic months for Alaska holidays, as these times can result in quieter visits. May is one of the driest months, so there's less chance of rain, and - happily - the chance of seeing wildlife is also increased. It's considered the best time to spot walrus, seals, whales, migratory songbirds and much more. September is mating season for many animals such as caribou, moose and muskoxen, while longer nights can increase the chances (without a guarantee, it should be said) of catching a rare glimpse of the glorious Northern Lights.

Choosing when to take an Asia cruise depends on what kind of atmosphere you're seeking. Autumn is a great time for leaf-peepers, who can take full advantage of the breathtaking vistas of Japan's luminous foliage. Typically, the spectacle peaks between mid-November and December, visible anywhere from the mountains of Hokkaido to the parks of Tokyo. In winter, Far East cruises offer a wholly different spectacle: that of snow-capped mountains, including Japan's majestic Mount Fuji. While the weather can be colder at this time of year, it's the perfect opportunity to take advantage of some warming specialities, like Japanese ramen, Korean tofu stew or a cup of rejuvenating tea, perfectly demonstrating some of the varied and inspired cuisine you'll find on Asian cruises. Springtime in Japan is justifiably renowned for its cherry blossoms, which typically bloom from late March in southern Tokyo and Hiroshima before reaching northern Sapporo and Aomori towards mid-April. Taipei experiences similar blooms, and these beautiful views - combined with the mild temperatures of this subtropical region - make spring one of the best times to visit Taiwan (China). What is the weather like in Asia and Far East? The weather on Far East cruises can vary a little depending on the season. The subtropical climate of Taiwan (China) makes it the perfect place to extend a continental summer, meaning that autumn (from September onwards) is a great time to visit. This period also avoids the particularly hot Taiwanese summers. Early autumn in Busan is clear and crisp (and things cool down even further from November), while a Japanese autumn is pleasantly temperate. In winter, Japan and the Republic of Korea cool down significantly. The crisp, bright days in some regions, like Hokkaido in far north Japan, are all the better for warming up with a cup of local tea. Cities like Tokyo and Kyoto tend to be milder, and in the Republic of Korea, Busan boasts the mildest weather nationwide, closely followed by Jeju Island. Taipei winters, meanwhile, are typically cool and dry, but with average lows of just 15\u00b0C, it's never too cold to explore. Spring (generally during March, April and May) in both Japan and Taiwan (China) is synonymous with cherry blossoms and pleasant temperatures. Busan, too, boasts mild weather in spring, though it can get chillier when strong spring winds blow. With so many different regions and so many climates to experience in different seasons, there's no end to the things you can do on an Asia cruise with MSC Cruises. Which ports do MSC Cruises visit in Asia and Far East? An Asia cruise with MSC Cruises affords near-endless possibilities for your Far East holidays. Japanese ports like Tokyo and Yokohama showcase a blend of innovation and ancestral traditions, while natural feats abound in ports like Kagoshima, known for its Sakurajima volcano, or Ishigaki, a gateway to the remote Yaeyama Islands (the southernmost and westernmost inhabited islands in Japan). From Kyoto's sacred Buddhist temples to Naha, the birthplace of karate, these Japanese ports are perfect for new discoveries. In Taiwan (China), cruises dock at the port of Keelung, part of the Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area. Here, Keelung's mighty mountain is juxtaposed with the bustling metropolis of Taipei. In China, ports in Shanghai and Shenzhen offer a modern inroad into some of the country's more ancient towns. These include the water village of Zhujiajiao, reachable via a coach ride past paddy fields, and the Dafen oil painting village, famous for its reproductions of international masterpieces. In the Republic of Korea, Busan is best known for its beaches and mountains, as well as its delicious culinary offerings. The port at Gangjeong on Jeju Island, a former fishing village now known for its proximity to some of the country's most stunning forests and beaches, boasts a plethora of outdoor activities including hiking, biking and watersports. Asia cruises may also dock in vibrant Hong Kong, the ruins of Aomori, or Japan's fugu capital, Shimonoseki. How much is a cruise to Asia and Far East? An Asia cruise is, of course, an incredible adventure, but with MSC Cruises, show-stopping destinations like Tokyo, Busan and Taipei are all reachable on any budget. The cost of your cruise will depend on a range of factors, including the season and length of the trip, but with our selection of Asia cruise deals, you'll be able to lock in your adventure at a fantastic price. What to pack for a cruise to Asia and Far East? Packing for your cruise doesn't need to be stressful. A few great staples will ensure you're comfortable on all of your Far East holidays. Be sure to take comfortable casual wear, as this will be perfect for daytime excursions and relaxing onboard. Light layers are best, in case the weather changes unexpectedly. In the evenings, you'll want a smarter look for the main dining rooms, theatre, bars or lounges: collared shirts, tailored trousers and dresses are all popular items. Be sure to pack a light jacket or jumper for chilly evenings and air-conditioned spaces. On Gala Night, pull out all the stops, perhaps with a tuxedo, evening gown or cocktail dress. Themed parties are an invitation to break out fun and elegant outfits. On Asia cruises, excursions to spots like Gangjeong on Jeju Island or Chung Cheng Park in Taiwan (China) are the perfect opportunity for a nature walk, so be sure to bring comfy walking shoes or hiking boots. Sports attire is a must to take advantage of the onboard gym, and don't forget swimming attire for a dip in the sea at Busan's Haeundae Beach. Many shore excursions include visits to religious sites, so be sure to plan accordingly, avoiding revealing clothing and sleeveless tops. And don't forget to leave some space in your bags - depending on your destinations, you may find that Asia cruises are a great opportunity to boost your wardrobe with fashionable finds in cities like Tokyo and Taipei. What is the currency in the Asian countries? Different currencies are in use in different Asian countries. The currency in Japan is the yen. In the Republic of Korea, the South Korean won is used. The currency in Taiwan (China) is the New Taiwan dollar, which replaced the old Taiwan dollar in 1949, while the currency in the People's Republic of China is the renminbi, also known as the Chinese yuan. What is the time zone in the Asian countries? On your Asia cruise, you'll be several hours ahead of local time back home. But the exact time difference will vary, depending not just on where but when you take your Asia holidays, since Asian countries do not observe daylight savings time. In British Summer Time, Japan and the Republic of Korea are eight hours ahead of London, while China and Taiwan (China) are seven hours ahead. In Standard Time, meanwhile, these time differences are increased by one hour, so Japan and the Republic of Korea are nine hours ahead of London, while China and Taiwan (China) are eight hours ahead. It bears mentioning that China specifically is an interesting case: given the size of the country, nearly that of the continental US, China could easily be divided into five time zones, but officially, the entire country uses just one. How long is a cruise to Asia and Far East? An Asia cruise with MSC Cruises can vary significantly in length, depending on how long you'd like your Far East holidays to last. The shortest Asia cruises are just three nights long, with cruises that may depart from Tokyo and land at Keelung (Taipei), or leave Keelung (Taipei) with stops in Ishigaki and Naha. A five-night itinerary provides ample time to journey from, for example, Tokyo to Naha by way of Keelung (Taipei) and Ishigaki. Longer itineraries in Asia last for 11 nights, offering the chance to visit a wide array of ports, from Tokyo to Muroran to Sakata, hopping over to Busan, Kochi and Osaka before returning to Tokyo. So, whether you're after a short jaunt to get a taste of Asia or you're keen to dive into an all-encompassing trip, MSC Cruises has the ideal itinerary for you. What countries are part of a cruise to Asia and Far Est? An Asia cruise offers almost limitless options when it comes to activities and experiences. Learn about artisanal crafts and cultural skills, such as Shanghai's calligraphy tradition, which can be seen along East Nanjing Road. Linger over the collections at outstanding museums, including Taipei's National Palace Museum, whose 700,000-piece collection is a journey through thousands of years of Chinese history and art. And don't forget the modernity that runs through these proudly contemporary cities, where skyscrapers are always an awe-inspiring sight. See the world from up high at Taipei's 101 Tower or the immense Tokyo Tower. Make sure to sample plenty of local cuisine throughout your travels. Whether it's Japanese sushi or the Republic of Korea's bulgogi and garlicky, spicy kimchi, you're sure to find a new favourite or two. These regions also boast abundant natural beauty. In Japan, spend time exploring the five-kilometre Gyokusendo Caves, studded with underground pools, or the Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park, known for its black pearl cultivation and white sand beaches. In the Republic of Korea, take in the volcanic island of Jeju, home to Jeongbang Waterfall, which cascades directly into the sea. These are just a few of the many highlights that can be encountered on Far East holidays. What are the best things to do in Asia and Far East? An Asia cruise blends innovation and tradition. Spend your holiday soaking up time-tested artisanal crafts and local cultural traditions, which might include anything from Okinawa's karate to Shanghai's calligraphy and silks. Linger over the collections at some of the continent's best museums, including Taipei's National Palace Museum. Historic temples abound on Far East holidays, from the ancient Baoan and Longshan temples to Busan's Beomeosa Temple, a Buddhist shrine dating to 678 AD, located at the base of Geumjeongsan Mountain. But don't neglect the modernity that governs these contemporary, skyscraper-peppered cities. Take a trip up Taipei's 101 Tower, a 101-storey, bamboo-shaped building, or the self-supporting steel Tokyo Tower. These regions also boast an abundance of natural beauty. In Japan, spend time exploring the five-kilometre Gyokusendo Caves and its underground pools, or the Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park, renowned for its white sand beaches.

Disembarkation Disembarkation timing There are two main options for disembarking the ship: 1. Assisted disembarkation If you placed your luggage outside your cabin the night before (before midnight) for delivery to the cruise terminal, you will receive luggage tags indicating your designated disembarkation time. This information is provided on a notice left in your cabin, alongside the numbered luggage tags. Each sailing operates on its own schedule, so the timings associated with the tags may vary. You will have to disembark at the time assigned, as leaving earlier than the designated time means waiting at the terminal for luggage to arrive. In many ports, the customs will not allow you to wait at the terminal for the luggage to come; therefore, you will be asked to re-embark the ship and wait on board. 2. Self-assist disembarkation Passengers carrying their own luggage can disembark as soon as local authorities clear the ship. The exact time varies but generally starts around 7:00 AM, subject to factors such as docking time and customs clearance. MSC requires passengers to vacate their cabins by 8:00 AM to allow the crew to prepare for the next voyage. By approximately 9:00 AM, announcements will begin prompting passengers to disembark, with further reminders issued if necessary. Timings are different according to the time spent in port, but in general, disembarkation will start 1 hour after arrival. Morning activities on disembarkation day While the crew focuses on preparing the ship for its next departure, some areas remain operational for passengers: \u2022 Dining : Breakfast is typically available at select venues, such as the buffet, Main Dining Room, and coffee shops on Deck 5 or 6. \u2022 Guest Services : Open for resolving any outstanding billing issues. Note that all balances must be cleared before disembarking. Most other amenities, including the pool, will be closed. Booking flights after disembarkation When scheduling your post-cruise flight, ensure sufficient time to disembark, travel to the airport, and pass through security. Booking a flight too early may result in delays or missed departures due to factors like: \u2022 Docking and customs clearance times. \u2022 Disembarkation queues and unforeseen delays. \u2022 Distance between the port and the airport. A general guideline is to allow at least five hours between the ship\u2019s arrival and your flight\u2019s departure. For airports located further from the port, add additional travel time. It is very important that you advise Guest Services of your flight departure time so that they can assign you the correct number/timing for disembarkation. Important pre-disembarkation tasks Before leaving the ship, complete the following steps: 1. Double-check your belongings Ensure you have retrieved all personal items from your cabin, including valuables from the safe, chargers, and children\u2019s toys. Retrieving forgotten items after disembarkation can be challenging. 2. Verify your account Confirm that your onboard account is settled. Guests with cash accounts must settle their balances at Guest Services, as disembarkation is not permitted until this is done. 3. Review charges Take a moment to review your final bill for accuracy and address any discrepancies before leaving. Post-disembarkation process Upon leaving the ship, you will retrieve your luggage from the designated area in the cruise terminal. Luggage will be grouped by tag numbers, and only called groups will be available for collection. Next, proceed through immigration. In the U.S., passengers with passports typically use facial recognition for a faster process, while those with birth certificates undergo manual inspection. In the EU, procedures vary based on the itinerary and Schengen regulations. After clearing immigration, arrange your transportation. Options include taxis, shuttle services, ride shares, and pre-arranged transfers. MSC offers transfers to major airports and cities in Italy, Spain, France, and Switzerland, with private car options available for other destinations.

This will help you to determine whether the accommodation we are able to provide is right for you and your party to travel safely and comfortably. Any accessibility or medical request can be flagged by completing the Accessibility&Medical Request Form available HERE and at all accredited travel agencies. This information should be provided at time of booking but no later than 30 days prior to sailing. If you are pregnant, the information should be provided at least 2 weeks before sailing date For service dogs this is required at least 60 days before the sailing date. Note that due to the complexity of the Worldcruise itinerary, early deadlines apply. This allows us time to provide the best possible service for our guests, which is determined by the facilities and resources on board each ship. If we do not receive timely notification, MSC Cruises cannot guarantee the requested accommodation. However, we will always strive to ensure every guest receives the accommodation they need to enjoy their time onboard. Due to the limited availability of accessible accommodation, guests are recommended to notify us as soon as possible as they will be allocated on a first come, first served basis . if you booked through our website, the documentation should be sent to the following email address: specialservicesuk@msccruises.co.uk opens in a new tab . However, If you booked your cruise through a travel agency, the documentation should be sent directly to your travel agent. 1.1 REDUCED MOBILITY For guests who primarily use a wheelchair or mobility scooter, we highly recommend reserving a cabin for guests with disabilities or reduced mobility . These cabins are specifically designed with enhanced accessible features, including handrails for support, ramps for easy balcony access, lower shelves for convenient storage, spacious wet-room-style bathrooms, and wider entrance doors for smoother navigation. These thoughtful features are incorporated to cater to the unique needs of individuals with reduced mobility, promoting a more comfortable and independent experience. While standard cabins may be suitable for guests with minor mobility impairments or those who do not require a wheelchair to move around the cabin, they are not suitable for guests who rely on a wheelchair as their primary means of mobility . Since availability of reduced mobility cabin is limited, and requests will be accommodated in a first come, first served basis, it is important to request it as soon as possible and consider also the possibility of considering eventually a different sailing date. If you choose to book a standard cabin, you are acknowledging that you can stand for brief moments and take a step without a mobility device and can access the bathroom area without additional supports (a shower stool can be requested, if needed). If you use a wheelchair or scooter, it\u2019s essential to verify that your wheelchair meets our size restrictions. The wheelchair should not exceed 50cm (20 inches) in width, have a weight limit of 45kgs (99 pounds) , and, when folded, should not exceed 50cm (20 inches) . These limitations are in place to ensure safe maneuverability and storage within the cabin space. For safety and convenience, wheelchairs, mobility scooters, and other assistive mobility devices must be stored inside your cabin when not in use. They cannot be stored in the hallways. Please take this into consideration when booking a regular cabin. This policy aligns with International Safety Regulations and helps maintain clear and safe passageways throughout the ship. Given the strict International Safety Regulations governing cruise ships and the limited capacity for carrying assistive mobility devices, it is imperative that you declare any wheelchairs or scooters you intend to bring onboard at the time of booking or as soon as you become aware of the need to bring them. This advance notice enables us to assess space availability and make the necessary arrangements to accommodate your device. Failure to provide this information at the time of booking may, regrettably, result in your device being denied boarding , a situation we are committed to helping you avoid. To further support guests with reduced mobility, MSC Cruises offers a range of services: Mobility Aids: Guests are welcome to bring manual or electric wheelchairs or scooters, as well as other mobility aids such as canes, rollators, walkers, and crutches, which need to be stored inside the cabin. Please be reminded to communicate it during your cruise reservation through the Accessibility&Medical Request Form opens in a new tab . If you plan to bring an electric wheelchair or scooter, please specify the type of battery it uses (gel, dry, or lithium). For safety reasons, wet batteries are not permitted on board MSC ships. Please confirm the dimensions of the specific vessel on which you will be sailing to ensure your mobility device comfortably navigates through the cabin door. Wheelchairs are available on board our ships, for the use of guests during embarkation and disembarkation only, or in case of emergency. Guests that require constant use of a wheelchair or any other form of support must bring their own equipment with them. It is the responsibility of the guest to check with the relevant producers/suppliers that this equipment is safe to take onboard and use on a cruise ship, and to organize both its delivery to the departure terminal in good time for embarkation, and its collection at the end of the cruise. Cabin Amenities: Upon request, we can provide a shower stool in standard cabins to enhance comfort and safety. Shore Excursions: MSC Cruises offers \" Easy & Accessible \" tours specifically designed for guests with reduced mobility. We recommend inquiring about the availability of these tours at the time of booking, as they may vary depending on the destination. Embarkation and Disembarkation Assistance: Please be informed that outside the cruise terminal assistance is not guaranteed. However, assistance is available from the ship to the pier and vice versa at ports of call, but once ashore MSC will no longer be able to provide assistance, and guests will need to be able to enjoy their visit autonomously. Airport and Flight Assistance: If you have booked your flights through MSC Cruises, you are requested to notify us at the time of the booking about any accessibility needs. Accessible transfers : Should you need to purchase a transfer from the airport to the cruise terminal and vice versa, please ensure you request an accessible transfer via your travel agents or our MSC Cruises Contact Centre. Tender Service: In some ports, due to operational needs, the ship is anchored, therefore guests will disembark from the ship using a complementary tender service that runs from ship to shore for the entire duration of the ship\u2019s stay in port. If the cruise itinerary includes ports where tender boats are used for shore access, please be aware that guests must be sufficiently fit and mobile to embark and disembark from the tender without assistance. This means that guests must take into consideration the use of steps, the possibility of gaps, height difference between the platform and the tender, the potential sudden movement of the tender, the dimensions and weight of the mobility device. Please be informed that crew members are not permitted to carry wheelchairs or mobility scooters into the tender. In case of any doubt about the itinerary, please feel free to reach out to our MSC Contact Center. To inform us of your reduced mobility need, please fill in the form at the following link Accessibility&Medical Request Form opens in a new tab 1.2 VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS Guests with visual impairments will find braille signs available at the entrance of the cabin door and safety instructions available in braille (on top of an English audible version). Moreover, majority of the onboard elevators' signs are in braille with the addition of the audio call signal on ships of last generation. For guests with partial visual impairment, the digital daily programs and menus can be available in large print versions, upon request. Service dogs are welcomed onboard our ships. Please refer to the dedicated session in chapter 1.8. While our onboard staff is committed to providing excellent service, it's important to note that they are not specifically trained to provide daily care or assistance with personal tasks such as eating, dressing, or personal hygiene, nor can offer a 24/7 guiding service. Upon embarkation day, an orientation tour of the ship can be offered upon request together with a meeting with our staff to provide a general overview of the ship\u2019s program and entertainment activities. The more information is provided, the more we will be able to provide accommodation for your needs. For example, knowing the degree of visual impairment and the level of autonomy will help us to understand the level of assistance you may require and allow us to provide appropriate support. To inform us of your visual impairment, please fill in the form at the following link Accessibility&Medical Request Form opens in a new tab 1.3 HEARING & SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS In accordance with International Safety Regulations (SOLAS), guests with hearing disabilities will automatically have a TDD/TTY System kit installed in their cabin. This kit typically includes light and vibrating devices installed under the mattress of the bed, a text phone to communicate with Reception-Guest Service, and an analog alarm clock to ensure you can receive important alerts and communicate effectively. As these kits are available in limited numbers on each ship, they will be assigned on a first come, first served basis. For minor hearing impairments, a sound amplifier is available at the main Reception-Guest Service to increase the quality of communication with our staff. Guests can also join a cruise with a sign language interpreter to further enhance communication access. A meeting with the onboard staff on embarkation day can be requested to have a general overview of the program of the ship and entertainments activities. To inform us of your request for your visual impairment, please fill in the form at the following link Accessibility&Medical Request Form opens in a new tab 1.4 RESPIRATORY NEEDS CPAP / BIPAP If you use a CPAP or BIPAP machine , kindly ensure that your device is compatible with the ship's power supply, which is 120V/60Hz or 240V/60Hz . Outlets in guest cabins accommodate both U.S.-style and Northern European-style plugs. We recommend carrying your electrical devices onboard as hand luggage to prevent any damage during transit. Complimentary distilled water and extension cords are available onboard; however, a charge will apply if the extension cord is not returned . For safety reasons, guests are not permitted to bring their own extension cords onboard. If you require any extension cords, please request them at the time of booking. Oxygen Please be aware that the onboard medical center has a limited oxygen supply, primarily intended for use by patients within the medical facility. Therefore, if you require long-term oxygen therapy, it is your responsibility to make arrangements for your regular oxygen needs while onboard. If you require oxygen, please note the following: Oxygen Concentrators: Like any other electrical device, oxygen concentrators must be compatible with the onboard power supply. Battery backup is recommended, and concentrators should be carried as hand luggage. Compressed Gas Cylinders: Arrangements for oxygen cylinder supply must be made through a vendor. The maximum permitted size is E or M-24 size ( 680 L at 2,200 psi ). For safety reasons, only one cylinder is allowed in the cabin at any time, although additional secure storage may be available upon request. Secure cylinder storage is limited and should be requested well in advance of your sailing date. You are responsible for ensuring that your supply has been delivered and safely stowed before sailing. Please be aware that oxygen cylinders may be restricted on flights, so it is your responsibility to consult with the airline prior to travel. Liquid Gas Reservoir: Liquid oxygen reservoirs with a maximum weight of 55kg may be permitted if suitable safe storage is available onboard. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Safety Department. Requests should be made at the time of booking or as soon as possible. You are responsible for filling portable cylinders, as the ship's crew is not trained to do this. Mechanical ventilation \u00b7 For guests who require mechanical ventilation, it is essential to provide detailed information at the time of booking or at least 30 days before sailing . This information should include details about the ventilator type, spare battery capacity, and the caregivers who are able to operate the equipment. We do not recommend traveling on remote itineraries, including ocean crossings, specific regions such as Antarctica or Africa, itineraries with multiple consecutive sea days, or in remote locations where resources are limited in case of device failure. To inform us of your respiratory need, please fill in the form at the following link Accessibility&Medical Request Form opens in a new tab 1.5 COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT To better anticipate the needs of our guests with cognitive, behavioral or mental health conditions, we recommend consulting with your doctor before your cruise and consider traveling with a companion for support in case of need as our staff cannot provide daily personal assistance. Our medical team handles emergencies, not daily care. Depending on local regulations, you might need a fitness-to-travel certificate. Be aware that the cruise environment has noise, crowds, and bright lights. Please take this into consideration together with the size of the ship in terms of guest capacity when choosing your cruise. Please be also advised that children with autism are welcome in our Mini Club provided they are toilet-trained and independent, as our youth staff who are fully trained in autism cannot assist with personal care. To inform us of your cognitive condition, please fill in the form at the following link Accessibility&Medical Request Form opens in a new tab 1.6 SPECIAL DIET & FOOD ALLERGIES, MEALS WITH GLUTEN-FREE INGREDIENTS, KOSHER MEALS & HALAL MEAT, VEGETARIAN & VEGAN MEALS MSC Cruises S.A. makes every effort to accommodate our guests' dietary requirements whenever possible. We keep special needs in mind when planning our menus and serving our meals. 1.6.1 ALLERGENS MSC Cruises S.A. is aware that some foods may cause an allergic reaction due to intolerance of some ingredients such as the 14 major recognized allergens listed in the Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 which are: gluten, soybean, peanuts, lupin, nuts or treenuts, sesame, crustaceans, fish, mollusc, dairy product, egg, mustard, celery sulphite & sulphur dioxide; therefore, guests are advised to inform the Company of any such allergy at the time of booking but not later than 30 days prior to sailing (by filling out the Accessibility Form ) . We further ask guests to report the special diet needs to Reception - Guest Service and the Ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel in the Main Dining Room upon first boarding the ship and prior to consuming any food or beverage onboard. Although there are several options at our various restaurants, our main dining rooms are best equipped to handle special dietary requests and reduce the unintentional risk of cross-contamination, we therefore strongly advise guests with allergies to have their meals in the main dining rooms, where our dining staff are best able to assist. Although MSC has implemented robust preventive measures, the risk of accidental allergen cross-contamination cannot be completely ruled out due to the limited space on the ship. We advise our guests who are knowledgeable about allergies or intolerances to always carry their prescribed emergency medications as directed by their physician, enabling them to respond effectively in the event of an allergic reaction. When booking a tour with a meal included, please remember to always communicate your special dietary need to the staff. Please be advised that on private islands and private beaches, we have limited capacity to ensure full allergen control. Consequently, MSC recommends that guests with specific dietary requirements have their meals in the Main Dining restaurant on board . 1.6.2 MEALS WITH GLUTEN-FREE INGREDIENTS MSC Cruises offers dedicated menus for meals with gluten-free ingredients (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) in the main restaurants on most of its ships. Guests sensitive to gluten should always reach out to the dining supervisor. Please be advised that on MSC Armonia, MSC Sinfonia, MSC Opera and MSC Lirica guests are offered only a limited selection of commercial, pre-packaged gluten-free snacks such as biscuits, croissants, sponge cakes and muffins. Coeliac guests or guests with sensitivity to gluten should always reach out to the dining supervisor instead. 1.6.3 KOSHER MEALS Kosher meals (pre-packaged breakfast, lunch, and dinner) may be available on board for an additional charge of \u20ac25/$30 pp/day. Kosher meals can be consumed in the main restaurants and must be booked at least 30 days before the ship\u2019s departure. Considering the restricted selection of choices, please do not forget to always specify any allergy or intolerance. 1.6.4 HALAL MEAT Halal products (beef, lamb and poultry) may be available on board following the former request of the guest at least 30 days before the ship\u2019s departure. If we are notified outside this deadline, we will do everything in our power to provide the services requested, but this cannot be guaranteed at such short notice. 1.6. 5 VEGETARIAN/ VEGAN MEALS Vegetarian and Vegan-friendly dishes are incorporated into our buffet and dining room culinary offerings. Our menu in the dining room includes always vegetarian and vegan options. 1.6.6 OTHER DIETARY REQUEST Guests who need to warm up baby formula or breast milk are referred to Room Service. For medical reasons or for infants, guests can specifically request some food to be blended onboard. Guests who for medical reasons wish to bring their own additives to the food served on board are directed to take care of mixing and dosing themselves for safety reasons. Following written approval from the Company, Guests can also bring their special sealed food on board. Products to be taken onboard should respect EU food labelling / packaging regulations and should not have an imminent expiry date. Once open they should be consumed as per instruction on the label. Our onboard staff are not authorized to store, cook or heat food items brought by guests. To inform us of your special dietary request, please fill in the form at the following link Accessibility&Medical Request Form opens in a new tab 1.7 IMPLANTED DEVICE Guests with implanted medical devices (for example pacemakers/defibrillators) are requested to inform our security staff at the time of embarkation, so the staff can provide safe, alternative screening. 1.8 SERVICE DOG 1.8.1 WHEN A DOG IS A SERVICE ANIMAL A service dog is a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability. The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person's disability. MSC welcomes service dogs on board its cruise vessels, provided they are in good health and in possession of all documents necessary for entry to the foreign countries visited during the cruise. For cruises including UK waters, the dog must be a full member of either Assistance Dogs International (ADI) or International Guide Dog Federation (IGDF) . Service dogs who are still in training, emotional support and companion animals are not recognized as assistance dogs, hence not allowed on MSC vessels. 1.8.2 SERVICE DOG ONBAORD A CRUISE SHIP MSC Cruises can provides a relief area with mulch but the guest, on his/her part, undertakes to be personally responsible for the custody, nutrition and general care of the animal throughout the period spent on board (with the help of a carer or fellow traveler if applicable) and for the possible damage caused by their service dog. If the service dog's behavior creates a fundamental alteration or a direct threat to safety, the dog may be denied boarding or removed from the ship along with the owner at the guest's expense. Service dogs are permitted to accompany the person with a disability in all public areas, including dining venues. While in public areas, dogs must be on a leash, harness, or other restraining device. Due to health regulations, service dogs are not permitted in recreational water facilities: pools, whirlpools, spray parks or Spa facilities. If the guest chooses to disembark the ship at a port at which the service dog must remain onboard, the guest must make arrangements to ensure that the dog is cared for. Note that the ship's staff are not available nor trained to care for the dog, nor can the dog be left in the cabin unattended. We do not offer the service of a vet on board and the ship's doctors are unable to assist. Due to the nature of some shore excursions, kindly note service animals may not be permitted. 1.8.3 SERVICE DOG\u2019S DOCUMENTATION It's the guest's responsibility to ensure that all documents related to the service dog are in compliance with all local regulations for each port of call of the itinerary and are submitted to the company at least 60 days prior to the start of the cruise. Please note that for the Worldcruise, documentation needs to be presented to the company at least 6 months prior to start the cruise as its special itinerary calls to more than 15 countries, and 50 ports, some of them very remote and with very strict bio-security requirements. Hard copies of the documents must be provided at embarkation and to Reception-Guest Service once onboard. Please be advised that in some ports of call the service dog might not be allowed to get off, according to local immigration rules. The documentation and immunization requirements are established by government authorities and not MSC Cruises. Please note requirements are subject to change without notice, and travel plans/certifications shall be shared with us to confirm compliance with all destinations Port Health Authorities, considering the departure/transit ports too. If any problem is experienced with the dog documentation upon entry in any port, all related costs for either the quarantine of or re-export of the dog will be the dog owner responsibility. Pet Passport and Third Country Certificates must be signed, dated and stamped by an Official Certified Veterinarian. Please be aware that obtaining those permits can take weeks or months, and some countries may not allow animals to enter at all. Copies of completed permits for each port of call must be sent to us as soon as available, prior to the sail date. Documentation that is required includes but not limited to: A brief, written explanation of what specific tasks the animal has been trained to perform must be provided.

In addition, we offer twice daily clinics for routine medical needs. Our onboard medical facilities meet or exceed the standards for cruise ship medical centres adopted by CLIA and include some diagnostic and treatment abilities; however, the ship\u2019s medical centers do not have the same resources as a land-based hospital. They are staffed by full-time registered doctors and nurses, including paramedics on some ships. Their primary role is to provide emergency medical care and short-term treatment, rather than long-term nursing care. Guests unable to manage their daily personal care activities (feeding, bathing, dressing and toileting etc.) should travel with a caregiver who can assist with these tasks. Please be advised that the non-medical staff on board are not specifically trained to give daily care and are not able to assist guests with personal tasks or personal hygiene needs (eating, dressing, bathroom or bathing). 2.2 PREGNANCY For the health and safety of both mother and unborn child, MSC Cruises cannot accommodate guests who will be more than 23 weeks and 6 days pregnant at any time during the cruise . If you are pregnant but will be less than 23 weeks and 6 days at any point during the cruise, you will need to provide a letter from your obstetrician/gynecologist confirming your expected due date, that your pregnancy is low-risk, and that you are fit to travel without immediate access to specialized obstetric or neonatal care.

This includes, but is not limited to: \u2022 Marijuana (including prescription / medical marijuana), or any derivatives of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) \u2022 Illegal narcotics / drugs including synthetic designer drugs / New Psychoactive Substances (NPS). 2.6 OTHER MEDICAL NEEDS To ensure the best possible care during your cruise, MSC Cruises Special Needs team will require full details of certain medical conditions or requests to assess whether your needs can be accommodated on board (please see some examples below). If there are any doubts, please contact the Special Needs team directly. If you or your travelling companion: Are undergoing chemotherapy or taking immunosuppressant medication. Please note that chemotherapy cannot be administered on board. Due to potential travel-related health risks, MSC strongly advises guests on immunosuppressant medication to consult their specialist and obtain clearance to cruise prior to boarding.

Send the completed and signed form to customerservice@msccruises.co.uk Requests are handled as quickly as possible. However, please allow up to 5 working days for processing and delivery 3.0 MSC WORLD CRUISE Due to the unique and varied ports of call on the World cruise itinerary, as well as the remote locations and limited availability of specialist medical support in some ports, all medical and accessibility requests must be communicated further in advance compared to regular cruises. This allows us to make the necessary checks and arrangements for your stay onboard. Regrettably we are unable to consider last-minute requests. Service animal requests need to be communicated at least 6 months before sailing date to allow checking with all different local authorities. Ports of call with a tender service may not be accessible for guests reliant on a wheelchair or scooter to travel or move around. Please feel free to request the list of ports with tender services before finalizing your booking. Mechanical ventilation and Peritoneal Dialysis are not available during the World cruise. Specific special diets including halal or kosher meals should be communicated at least 3 months before sailing . Please be reminded that during the Worldcruise, MSC Cruises will not accept guests who will be more than 23 weeks plus 6 days pregnant at any time during the cruise. For more information, please refer to the page here Internet What is satellite internet access and how does it work? When at sea, it is not possible to access the internet using a high-speed broadband connection as you would on land. Instead, internet connectivity on board is provided by links between the ship and communications satellites in orbit far above the Earth. Why is satellite internet access slower than a normal connection on land? Your internet data needs to travel vast distances between the ship's antennae and the nearest satellite, and it needs an unobstructed line of sight between them. A number of things may interfere with this, like storms and large objects that can block the signal, such as steep mountains close to the ship or tall buildings in ports. This interference can result in slow response times or even the system becoming unresponsive. Where is satellite internet access available on board? Satellite Internet Access is available in all public areas of the ship and in most cabins, including all MSC Yacht Club suites. All you need is one of our Satellite Internet Access packages and a mobile internet device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc.). What is the main difference between Browse and Browse & Stream packages? With the Browse & Stream package it is possible to use video calls, stream music and videos. Those cannot be used with the Browse package. For more information visit our dedicated website. When is the best/worst time to use satellite internet access? Congestion can make internet access slower, just as it would on land. It is therefore best to avoid these periods if possible. How much does each satellite internet access package cost? Packages are available either per day or for the duration of your cruise. The \"per cruise\" rate is based on the length of the cruise. To see prices for a specific cruise, go to the \"Wifi\" section of the website or consult the ship's network while on board. Is it possible to upgrade from the Browse package to the Browse & Stream one? Yes. You will be able to upgrade your package on board through the MSC Captive Portal (the website used to activate the pre-paid package). You can upgrade to a Browse package with additional devices or to the Browse & Stream package. You will only pay the difference between the full costs packages (to preserve the 20% discount advantage). Why is satellite internet access more expensive than a normal connection on land? Providing internet access on board via the ship's satellite connectivity involves significant investment in cutting-edge technology. The fees charged to those using the Satellite Internet Access service help cover the considerable costs of providing the service. Is the price for satellite internet access the same on every ship? No, on ships offering a premium service called Satellite Internet Plus, the rate is higher. Ships with this service include MSC Seaside, MSC Seaview, and MSC Splendida. Guests will experience faster speed and a better connection on these ships. Why does my internet connection cut off after [xx] minutes? When a user is logged on, updates and apps running in the background can increase traffic even when he/she is not actively using the internet. In order to reduce congestion and speed up internet access for active users, the system will automatically disconnect each user after XX minutes. To avoid being disconnected, you can return to this page before the XX minutes have elapsed and RESET the countdown. If you are automatically logged out by the system, you can reactivate your connection by simply clicking START. The package details include an allowance of mb per day/per cruise. What is a MB? MB stands for 'megabyte', which means 1 million bytes. It is a measure of the amount of information sent or received across an internet connection. For example, one photo upload to social media is approximately 5MB. Laundry Laundry packages Everyone loves the feel of freshly-laundered clothes and the convenience of a same-day laundry service.

Accessible tours Who can book the Easy and Accessible shore excursions? These easy tours are available for all guests and are wheelchair accessible. This program is designed to provide memorable, enjoyable experiences for limited-mobility guests, seniors, and anyone who enjoys a slower pace, as well as their families. How are the Easy & Accessible shore excursions different from other regular shore excursions? Easy & Accessible excursions are unique in that they offer: - Completely step-free tour routes - Wheelchair Accessible vehicles - Shorter distances - Slower pace - Accessible restrooms with wide doors along the route - Professional and compassionate tour guides experienced in working with senior and limited mobility clients What type of vehicles are used for the Easy & Accessible shore excursions? Easy & Accessible shore excursions use accessible vehicles equipped with either a ramp or lift for easy wheelchair access. How can I trust that these tours are fully accessible? Our Easy & Accessible shore experiences have been designed and vetted over many years by world-renowned accessibility experts and by travellers with disabilities. Routes are verified and tested consistently to meet the high standards set by MSC Cruises. How big are the groups for the Easy & Accessible shore excursions? To make these tours more enjoyable, group sizes are smaller than regular tours - these are not large motor coach groups. For most tours, small accessible vans are used. How will the guide assist me with my mobility needs? The tour guides conducting these accessible tours have several years of experience in touring with limited mobility guests and their families. They are patient, compassionate and very knowledgeable. Please note that guides are not permitted to push wheelchairs. Guests in wheelchairs must be able to self-propel or have a companion push them. What can I expect from my Easy & Accessible shore excursions? Accessible shore excursions are authentic experiences, designed to limit the amount of walking, without compromising on the experience. If you are asking yourself: \"Will I get to leave the bus?\", the answer is \"Yes!\".

Think snow-capped mountains, fjords and otherworldly glaciers, plus grizzlies skulking around forests and channels filled with humpback whales. There are few places in the world like it - it has the biggest concentration of glaciers in North America (nearly 100,000), as well as the highest population of grizzly bears. The state is also widely known for its invaluable Indigenous culture dating back thousands of years - discovering Alaskan Native heritage is a must during any cruise in Alaska, whether that's by visiting museums, watching traditional cultural performances or admiring intricate totem poles. What to do in Alaska? There's truly something for everyone on a cruise through Alaska. History buffs can brush up on the Gold Rush, foodies can sample local specialities (including Inuit ice cream), while those curious about culture can learn about the Indigenous peoples of Alaska and traditions like carving totem poles. Luckily, Ketchikan's Creek Street is a fine place to do all three of these things. Its antique boardwalk has a storied past and is now home to inviting restaurants and shops. Plus, it's also a top vantage point for seeing salmon, as well as being located right by some of the town's beautiful totem poles. See more at Saxman Village's Totem Park, also in Ketchikan. More than anything, though, holidays to Alaska are all about the outdoors. Hiking trails are abundant, though Nugget Falls Trail is an easy and popular route near Juneau that stops at a huge waterfall. There are also thousands of stunning glaciers to visit, with Mendenhall Glacier both one of the most accessible and most beautiful. It's also very likely that your trip will involve at least a handful of exciting wildlife encounters. Sitka, Icy Strait Point, Ketchikan, Tracy Arm fjord and Juneau all offer whale watching tours and chances to see all kinds of bears. It's also entirely possible that you'll spot sea lions, caribou, salmon, otters and bald eagles during your holiday. What other countries are included in a cruise that goes to Alaska? Guests on one of our cruises to Alaska will also get to enjoy the wonders of Canada, as our itineraries end in Victoria, the gorgeous and culture-crammed capital of British Columbia. The rest of the time is spent in the US, with all ships leaving from vibrant Seattle, Washington, before sailing Alaska's Inside Passage. How long are Alaska cruises? Most of our Alaska cruise itineraries last for seven nights. This is a fantastic amount of time to spend enjoying this genuinely magnificent region, as you'll be able to sail the Inside Passage route and visit some of the state's most popular destinations - all at a relaxing pace. Where do Alaska cruises leave from? Seattle is the only embarkation port for our Alaska cruises. As Washington State's largest city, it's got plenty to explore before you leave on your voyage. Take a ride to the top of the Space Needle - the iconic observation tower that dominates the city's skyline - or hop aboard the Seattle Center Monorail. Downtown, spend some time browsing the stalls at the centuries-old Pike Place Market, get cultural at the Seattle Art Museum or cheer on the Seattle Mariners at baseball field T-Mobile Park. Seattle is also the home of Starbucks, and coffee-lovers should absolutely seek out the Starbucks Reserve Roastery for an awakening experience. Little wonder that we decided to start our Alaska cruises from Seattle. What to pack for a cruise to Alaska? Packing for holidays in Alaska can be a breeze - sometimes quite literally. Even though temperatures in spring and summer are thoroughly pleasant, there can also be some wind and rainfall, so you'll need to pack light layers, long-sleeve jumpers and a jacket or two - ideally including a waterproof jacket, just in case. But don't let the mention of waterproofs allow you to forget to bring a sunhat and high-SPF sun cream, too. Good walking shoes or hiking shoes are essential, so that you can get out into the wilderness in comfort. It's also recommended to pack some more formal clothes and shoes for evenings, particularly Gala Night, where passengers love looking their best. However, your most important item to pack for cruises in Alaska will always be a camera, allowing you to capture the breathtaking scenery and the once-in-a-lifetime wildlife encounters that surround you. How much is a cruise to Alaska? No matter what your budget might be, MSC Cruises has an option for you, as you'll see when you take a look at our Alaska cruise deals. Bring that dream trip a little closer and start planning right now - find the best Alaska cruise deals here our website. Which ports do MSC Cruises visit in Alaska? Our Alaska cruises from Seattle call at five different but equally enticing ports in Alaska. Ketchikan is known for its rich Alaska Native culture, including more than 80 totem poles, while Icy Strait Point in Hoonah is great for spotting wildlife and zooming down huge zip-lines. Gaze out at awe-inspiring glaciers and icebergs in Tracy Arm fjord, go hiking or discover local heritage in Sitka, or try whale watching in Alaska's capital, Juneau. All five places are enlightening, must-visit destinations on a holiday to Alaska. What is the weather like in Alaska? It's always important to consider the weather when booking an Alaska cruise. The sunniest and warmest time is from June to August. It's never overly hot, though, with highs between 15\u00b0C and 19\u00b0C. May temperatures are also pleasant - plus, this is often the month with the least rainfall. September is fairly dry as well, but also starts getting a little cooler, with an average high of 13\u00b0C. Outside of these times brings shorter days and extreme cold in some months, demonstrating that the best time for your Alaska cruise is from May to September. When is the best time to cruise Alaska? Our Alaska cruises set sail between May and September, which are the best months to visit this northernmost US state. June, July and August will appeal to many thanks to their warmer temperatures. However, May and September are also fantastic months for Alaska holidays, as these times can result in quieter visits. May is one of the driest months, so there's less chance of rain, and - happily - the chance of seeing wildlife is also increased. It's considered the best time to spot walrus, seals, whales, migratory songbirds and much more. September is mating season for many animals such as caribou, moose and muskoxen, while longer nights can increase the chances (without a guarantee, it should be said) of catching a rare glimpse of the glorious Northern Lights.

Choosing when to take an Asia cruise depends on what kind of atmosphere you're seeking. Autumn is a great time for leaf-peepers, who can take full advantage of the breathtaking vistas of Japan's luminous foliage. Typically, the spectacle peaks between mid-November and December, visible anywhere from the mountains of Hokkaido to the parks of Tokyo. In winter, Far East cruises offer a wholly different spectacle: that of snow-capped mountains, including Japan's majestic Mount Fuji. While the weather can be colder at this time of year, it's the perfect opportunity to take advantage of some warming specialities, like Japanese ramen, Korean tofu stew or a cup of rejuvenating tea, perfectly demonstrating some of the varied and inspired cuisine you'll find on Asian cruises. Springtime in Japan is justifiably renowned for its cherry blossoms, which typically bloom from late March in southern Tokyo and Hiroshima before reaching northern Sapporo and Aomori towards mid-April. Taipei experiences similar blooms, and these beautiful views - combined with the mild temperatures of this subtropical region - make spring one of the best times to visit Taiwan (China). What is the weather like in Asia and Far East? The weather on Far East cruises can vary a little depending on the season. The subtropical climate of Taiwan (China) makes it the perfect place to extend a continental summer, meaning that autumn (from September onwards) is a great time to visit. This period also avoids the particularly hot Taiwanese summers. Early autumn in Busan is clear and crisp (and things cool down even further from November), while a Japanese autumn is pleasantly temperate. In winter, Japan and the Republic of Korea cool down significantly. The crisp, bright days in some regions, like Hokkaido in far north Japan, are all the better for warming up with a cup of local tea. Cities like Tokyo and Kyoto tend to be milder, and in the Republic of Korea, Busan boasts the mildest weather nationwide, closely followed by Jeju Island. Taipei winters, meanwhile, are typically cool and dry, but with average lows of just 15\u00b0C, it's never too cold to explore. Spring (generally during March, April and May) in both Japan and Taiwan (China) is synonymous with cherry blossoms and pleasant temperatures. Busan, too, boasts mild weather in spring, though it can get chillier when strong spring winds blow. With so many different regions and so many climates to experience in different seasons, there's no end to the things you can do on an Asia cruise with MSC Cruises. Which ports do MSC Cruises visit in Asia and Far East? An Asia cruise with MSC Cruises affords near-endless possibilities for your Far East holidays. Japanese ports like Tokyo and Yokohama showcase a blend of innovation and ancestral traditions, while natural feats abound in ports like Kagoshima, known for its Sakurajima volcano, or Ishigaki, a gateway to the remote Yaeyama Islands (the southernmost and westernmost inhabited islands in Japan). From Kyoto's sacred Buddhist temples to Naha, the birthplace of karate, these Japanese ports are perfect for new discoveries. In Taiwan (China), cruises dock at the port of Keelung, part of the Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area. Here, Keelung's mighty mountain is juxtaposed with the bustling metropolis of Taipei. In China, ports in Shanghai and Shenzhen offer a modern inroad into some of the country's more ancient towns. These include the water village of Zhujiajiao, reachable via a coach ride past paddy fields, and the Dafen oil painting village, famous for its reproductions of international masterpieces. In the Republic of Korea, Busan is best known for its beaches and mountains, as well as its delicious culinary offerings. The port at Gangjeong on Jeju Island, a former fishing village now known for its proximity to some of the country's most stunning forests and beaches, boasts a plethora of outdoor activities including hiking, biking and watersports. Asia cruises may also dock in vibrant Hong Kong, the ruins of Aomori, or Japan's fugu capital, Shimonoseki. How much is a cruise to Asia and Far East? An Asia cruise is, of course, an incredible adventure, but with MSC Cruises, show-stopping destinations like Tokyo, Busan and Taipei are all reachable on any budget. The cost of your cruise will depend on a range of factors, including the season and length of the trip, but with our selection of Asia cruise deals, you'll be able to lock in your adventure at a fantastic price. What to pack for a cruise to Asia and Far East? Packing for your cruise doesn't need to be stressful. A few great staples will ensure you're comfortable on all of your Far East holidays. Be sure to take comfortable casual wear, as this will be perfect for daytime excursions and relaxing onboard. Light layers are best, in case the weather changes unexpectedly. In the evenings, you'll want a smarter look for the main dining rooms, theatre, bars or lounges: collared shirts, tailored trousers and dresses are all popular items. Be sure to pack a light jacket or jumper for chilly evenings and air-conditioned spaces. On Gala Night, pull out all the stops, perhaps with a tuxedo, evening gown or cocktail dress. Themed parties are an invitation to break out fun and elegant outfits. On Asia cruises, excursions to spots like Gangjeong on Jeju Island or Chung Cheng Park in Taiwan (China) are the perfect opportunity for a nature walk, so be sure to bring comfy walking shoes or hiking boots. Sports attire is a must to take advantage of the onboard gym, and don't forget swimming attire for a dip in the sea at Busan's Haeundae Beach. Many shore excursions include visits to religious sites, so be sure to plan accordingly, avoiding revealing clothing and sleeveless tops. And don't forget to leave some space in your bags - depending on your destinations, you may find that Asia cruises are a great opportunity to boost your wardrobe with fashionable finds in cities like Tokyo and Taipei. What is the currency in the Asian countries? Different currencies are in use in different Asian countries. The currency in Japan is the yen. In the Republic of Korea, the South Korean won is used. The currency in Taiwan (China) is the New Taiwan dollar, which replaced the old Taiwan dollar in 1949, while the currency in the People's Republic of China is the renminbi, also known as the Chinese yuan. What is the time zone in the Asian countries? On your Asia cruise, you'll be several hours ahead of local time back home. But the exact time difference will vary, depending not just on where but when you take your Asia holidays, since Asian countries do not observe daylight savings time. In British Summer Time, Japan and the Republic of Korea are eight hours ahead of London, while China and Taiwan (China) are seven hours ahead. In Standard Time, meanwhile, these time differences are increased by one hour, so Japan and the Republic of Korea are nine hours ahead of London, while China and Taiwan (China) are eight hours ahead. It bears mentioning that China specifically is an interesting case: given the size of the country, nearly that of the continental US, China could easily be divided into five time zones, but officially, the entire country uses just one. How long is a cruise to Asia and Far East? An Asia cruise with MSC Cruises can vary significantly in length, depending on how long you'd like your Far East holidays to last. The shortest Asia cruises are just three nights long, with cruises that may depart from Tokyo and land at Keelung (Taipei), or leave Keelung (Taipei) with stops in Ishigaki and Naha. A five-night itinerary provides ample time to journey from, for example, Tokyo to Naha by way of Keelung (Taipei) and Ishigaki. Longer itineraries in Asia last for 11 nights, offering the chance to visit a wide array of ports, from Tokyo to Muroran to Sakata, hopping over to Busan, Kochi and Osaka before returning to Tokyo. So, whether you're after a short jaunt to get a taste of Asia or you're keen to dive into an all-encompassing trip, MSC Cruises has the ideal itinerary for you. What countries are part of a cruise to Asia and Far Est? An Asia cruise offers almost limitless options when it comes to activities and experiences. Learn about artisanal crafts and cultural skills, such as Shanghai's calligraphy tradition, which can be seen along East Nanjing Road. Linger over the collections at outstanding museums, including Taipei's National Palace Museum, whose 700,000-piece collection is a journey through thousands of years of Chinese history and art. And don't forget the modernity that runs through these proudly contemporary cities, where skyscrapers are always an awe-inspiring sight. See the world from up high at Taipei's 101 Tower or the immense Tokyo Tower. Make sure to sample plenty of local cuisine throughout your travels. Whether it's Japanese sushi or the Republic of Korea's bulgogi and garlicky, spicy kimchi, you're sure to find a new favourite or two. These regions also boast abundant natural beauty. In Japan, spend time exploring the five-kilometre Gyokusendo Caves, studded with underground pools, or the Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park, known for its black pearl cultivation and white sand beaches. In the Republic of Korea, take in the volcanic island of Jeju, home to Jeongbang Waterfall, which cascades directly into the sea. These are just a few of the many highlights that can be encountered on Far East holidays. What are the best things to do in Asia and Far East? An Asia cruise blends innovation and tradition. Spend your holiday soaking up time-tested artisanal crafts and local cultural traditions, which might include anything from Okinawa's karate to Shanghai's calligraphy and silks. Linger over the collections at some of the continent's best museums, including Taipei's National Palace Museum. Historic temples abound on Far East holidays, from the ancient Baoan and Longshan temples to Busan's Beomeosa Temple, a Buddhist shrine dating to 678 AD, located at the base of Geumjeongsan Mountain. But don't neglect the modernity that governs these contemporary, skyscraper-peppered cities. Take a trip up Taipei's 101 Tower, a 101-storey, bamboo-shaped building, or the self-supporting steel Tokyo Tower. These regions also boast an abundance of natural beauty. In Japan, spend time exploring the five-kilometre Gyokusendo Caves and its underground pools, or the Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park, renowned for its white sand beaches.

Disembarkation Disembarkation timing There are two main options for disembarking the ship: 1. Assisted disembarkation If you placed your luggage outside your cabin the night before (before midnight) for delivery to the cruise terminal, you will receive luggage tags indicating your designated disembarkation time. This information is provided on a notice left in your cabin, alongside the numbered luggage tags. Each sailing operates on its own schedule, so the timings associated with the tags may vary. You will have to disembark at the time assigned, as leaving earlier than the designated time means waiting at the terminal for luggage to arrive. In many ports, the customs will not allow you to wait at the terminal for the luggage to come; therefore, you will be asked to re-embark the ship and wait on board. 2. Self-assist disembarkation Passengers carrying their own luggage can disembark as soon as local authorities clear the ship. The exact time varies but generally starts around 7:00 AM, subject to factors such as docking time and customs clearance. MSC requires passengers to vacate their cabins by 8:00 AM to allow the crew to prepare for the next voyage. By approximately 9:00 AM, announcements will begin prompting passengers to disembark, with further reminders issued if necessary. Timings are different according to the time spent in port, but in general, disembarkation will start 1 hour after arrival. Morning activities on disembarkation day While the crew focuses on preparing the ship for its next departure, some areas remain operational for passengers: \u2022 Dining : Breakfast is typically available at select venues, such as the buffet, Main Dining Room, and coffee shops on Deck 5 or 6. \u2022 Guest Services : Open for resolving any outstanding billing issues. Note that all balances must be cleared before disembarking. Most other amenities, including the pool, will be closed. Booking flights after disembarkation When scheduling your post-cruise flight, ensure sufficient time to disembark, travel to the airport, and pass through security. Booking a flight too early may result in delays or missed departures due to factors like: \u2022 Docking and customs clearance times. \u2022 Disembarkation queues and unforeseen delays. \u2022 Distance between the port and the airport. A general guideline is to allow at least five hours between the ship\u2019s arrival and your flight\u2019s departure. For airports located further from the port, add additional travel time. It is very important that you advise Guest Services of your flight departure time so that they can assign you the correct number/timing for disembarkation. Important pre-disembarkation tasks Before leaving the ship, complete the following steps: 1. Double-check your belongings Ensure you have retrieved all personal items from your cabin, including valuables from the safe, chargers, and children\u2019s toys. Retrieving forgotten items after disembarkation can be challenging. 2. Verify your account Confirm that your onboard account is settled.

This will help you to determine whether the accommodation we are able to provide is right for you and your party to travel safely and comfortably. Any accessibility or medical request can be flagged by completing the Accessibility&Medical Request Form available HERE and at all accredited travel agencies. This information should be provided at time of booking but no later than 30 days prior to sailing. - If you are pregnant, the information should be provided at least 2 weeks before sailing date * For service dogs this is required at least 60 days before the sailing date. - Note that due to the complexity of the Worldcruise itinerary, early deadlines apply. This allows us time to provide the best possible service for our guests, which is determined by the facilities and resources on board each ship. If we do not receive timely notification, MSC Cruises cannot guarantee the requested accommodation. However, we will always strive to ensure every guest receives the accommodation they need to enjoy their time onboard. Due to the limited availability of accessible accommodation, guests are recommended to notify us as soon as possible as they will be allocated on a first come, first served basis . if you booked through our website, the documentation should be sent to the following email address: specialservicesuk@msccruises.co.ukopens in a new tab . However, If you booked your cruise through a travel agency, the documentation should be sent directly to your travel agent. 1.1 REDUCED MOBILITY For guests who primarily use a wheelchair or mobility scooter, we highly recommend reserving a cabin for guests with disabilities or reduced mobility . These cabins are specifically designed with enhanced accessible features, including handrails for support, ramps for easy balcony access, lower shelves for convenient storage, spacious wet-room-style bathrooms, and wider entrance doors for smoother navigation. These thoughtful features are incorporated to cater to the unique needs of individuals with reduced mobility, promoting a more comfortable and independent experience. While standard cabins may be suitable for guests with minor mobility impairments or those who do not require a wheelchair to move around the cabin, they are not suitable for guests who rely on a wheelchair as their primary means of mobility . Since availability of reduced mobility cabin is limited, and requests will be accommodated in a first come, first served basis, it is important to request it as soon as possible and consider also the possibility of considering eventually a different sailing date. If you choose to book a standard cabin, you are acknowledging that you can stand for brief moments and take a step without a mobility device and can access the bathroom area without additional supports (a shower stool can be requested, if needed). If you use a wheelchair or scooter, it\u2019s essential to verify that your wheelchair meets our size restrictions. The wheelchair should not exceed 50cm (20 inches) in width, have a weight limit of 45kgs (99 pounds) , and, when folded, should not exceed 50cm (20 inches) . These limitations are in place to ensure safe maneuverability and storage within the cabin space. For safety and convenience, wheelchairs, mobility scooters, and other assistive mobility devices must be stored inside your cabin when not in use. They cannot be stored in the hallways. Please take this into consideration when booking a regular cabin. This policy aligns with International Safety Regulations and helps maintain clear and safe passageways throughout the ship. Given the strict International Safety Regulations governing cruise ships and the limited capacity for carrying assistive mobility devices, it is imperative that you declare any wheelchairs or scooters you intend to bring onboard at the time of booking or as soon as you become aware of the need to bring them. This advance notice enables us to assess space availability and make the necessary arrangements to accommodate your device. Failure to provide this information at the time of booking may, regrettably, result in your device being denied boarding , a situation we are committed to helping you avoid. To further support guests with reduced mobility, MSC Cruises offers a range of services: - Mobility Aids: Guests are welcome to bring manual or electric wheelchairs or scooters, as well as other mobility aids such as canes, rollators, walkers, and crutches, which need to be stored inside the cabin. Please be reminded to communicate it during your cruise reservation through the Accessibility&Medical Request Formopens in a new tab . If you plan to bring an electric wheelchair or scooter, please specify the type of battery it uses (gel, dry, or lithium). For safety reasons, wet batteries are not permitted on board MSC ships. Please confirm the dimensions of the specific vessel on which you will be sailing to ensure your mobility device comfortably navigates through the cabin door. Wheelchairs are available on board our ships, for the use of guests during embarkation and disembarkation only, or in case of emergency. Guests that require constant use of a wheelchair or any other form of support must bring their own equipment with them. It is the responsibility of the guest to check with the relevant producers/suppliers that this equipment is safe to take onboard and use on a cruise ship, and to organize both its delivery to the departure terminal in good time for embarkation, and its collection at the end of the cruise. - Cabin Amenities: Upon request, we can provide a shower stool in standard cabins to enhance comfort and safety. * Shore Excursions: MSC Cruises offers \" Easy & Accessible \" tours specifically designed for guests with reduced mobility. We recommend inquiring about the availability of these tours at the time of booking, as they may vary depending on the destination. - Embarkation and Disembarkation Assistance: Please be informed that outside the cruise terminal assistance is not guaranteed. However, assistance is available from the ship to the pier and vice versa at ports of call, but once ashore MSC will no longer be able to provide assistance, and guests will need to be able to enjoy their visit autonomously. * Airport and Flight Assistance: If you have booked your flights through MSC Cruises, you are requested to notify us at the time of the booking about any accessibility needs. - Accessible transfers : Should you need to purchase a transfer from the airport to the cruise terminal and vice versa, please ensure you request an accessible transfer via your travel agents or our MSC Cruises Contact Centre. Tender Service: In some ports, due to operational needs, the ship is anchored, therefore guests will disembark from the ship using a complementary tender service that runs from ship to shore for the entire duration of the ship\u2019s stay in port. If the cruise itinerary includes ports where tender boats are used for shore access, please be aware that guests must be sufficiently fit and mobile to embark and disembark from the tender without assistance. This means that guests must take into consideration the use of steps, the possibility of gaps, height difference between the platform and the tender, the potential sudden movement of the tender, the dimensions and weight of the mobility device. Please be informed that crew members are not permitted to carry wheelchairs or mobility scooters into the tender. In case of any doubt about the itinerary, please feel free to reach out to our MSC Contact Center.

As these kits are available in limited numbers on each ship, they will be assigned on a first come, first served basis. For minor hearing impairments, a sound amplifier is available at the main Reception-Guest Service to increase the quality of communication with our staff. Guests can also join a cruise with a sign language interpreter to further enhance communication access.

Outlets in guest cabins accommodate both U.S.-style and Northern European-style plugs. We recommend carrying your electrical devices onboard as hand luggage to prevent any damage during transit. Complimentary distilled water and extension cords are available onboard; however, a charge will apply if the extension cord is not returned. For safety reasons, guests are not permitted to bring their own extension cords onboard. If you require any extension cords, please request them at the time of booking. Oxygen Please be aware that the onboard medical center has a limited oxygen supply, primarily intended for use by patients within the medical facility. Therefore, if you require long-term oxygen therapy, it is your responsibility to make arrangements for your regular oxygen needs while onboard. If you require oxygen, please note the following: - Oxygen Concentrators: Like any other electrical device, oxygen concentrators must be compatible with the onboard power supply. Battery backup is recommended, and concentrators should be carried as hand luggage. * Compressed Gas Cylinders: Arrangements for oxygen cylinder supply must be made through a vendor. The maximum permitted size is E or M-24 size ( 680 L at 2,200 psi ). For safety reasons, only one cylinder is allowed in the cabin at any time, although additional secure storage may be available upon request. Secure cylinder storage is limited and should be requested well in advance of your sailing date. You are responsible for ensuring that your supply has been delivered and safely stowed before sailing. Please be aware that oxygen cylinders may be restricted on flights, so it is your responsibility to consult with the airline prior to travel. - Liquid Gas Reservoir: Liquid oxygen reservoirs with a maximum weight of 55kg may be permitted if suitable safe storage is available onboard. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Safety Department. Requests should be made at the time of booking or as soon as possible. You are responsible for filling portable cylinders, as the ship's crew is not trained to do this. Mechanical ventilation \u00b7 For guests who require mechanical ventilation, it is essential to provide detailed information at the time of booking or at least 30 days before sailing . This information should include details about the ventilator type, spare battery capacity, and the caregivers who are able to operate the equipment.

Depending on local regulations, you might need a fitness-to-travel certificate. * Be aware that the cruise environment has noise, crowds, and bright lights. Please take this into consideration together with the size of the ship in terms of guest capacity when choosing your cruise.

We keep special needs in mind when planning our menus and serving our meals. 1.6.1 ALLERGENS MSC Cruises S.A. is aware that some foods may cause an allergic reaction due to intolerance of some ingredients such as the 14 major recognized allergens listed in the Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 which are: gluten, soybean, peanuts, lupin, nuts or treenuts, sesame, crustaceans, fish, mollusc, dairy product, egg, mustard, celery sulphite & sulphur dioxide; therefore, guests are advised to inform the Company of any such allergy at the time of booking but not later than 30 days prior to sailing (by filling out the Accessibility Form ) . We further ask guests to report the special diet needs to Reception - Guest Service and the Ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel in the Main Dining Room upon first boarding the ship and prior to consuming any food or beverage onboard. Although there are several options at our various restaurants, our main dining rooms are best equipped to handle special dietary requests and reduce the unintentional risk of cross-contamination, we therefore strongly advise guests with allergies to have their meals in the main dining rooms, where our dining staff are best able to assist. Although MSC has implemented robust preventive measures, the risk of accidental allergen cross-contamination cannot be completely ruled out due to the limited space on the ship. We advise our guests who are knowledgeable about allergies or intolerances to always carry their prescribed emergency medications as directed by their physician, enabling them to respond effectively in the event of an allergic reaction. When booking a tour with a meal included, please remember to always communicate your special dietary need to the staff. Please be advised that on private islands and private beaches, we have limited capacity to ensure full allergen control. Consequently, MSC recommends that guests with specific dietary requirements have their meals in the Main Dining restaurant on board. 1.6.2 MEALS WITH GLUTEN-FREE INGREDIENTS MSC Cruises offers dedicated menus for meals with gluten-free ingredients (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) in the main restaurants on most of its ships. Guests sensitive to gluten should always reach out to the dining supervisor. Please be advised that on MSC Armonia, MSC Sinfonia, MSC Opera and MSC Lirica guests are offered only a limited selection of commercial, pre-packaged gluten-free snacks such as biscuits, croissants, sponge cakes and muffins. Coeliac guests or guests with sensitivity to gluten should always reach out to the dining supervisor instead. 1.6.3 KOSHER MEALS Kosher meals (pre-packaged breakfast, lunch, and dinner) may be available on board for an additional charge of \u20ac25/$30 pp/day. Kosher meals can be consumed in the main restaurants and must be booked at least 30 days before the ship\u2019s departure. Considering the restricted selection of choices, please do not forget to always specify any allergy or intolerance. 1.6.4 HALAL MEAT Halal products (beef, lamb and poultry) may be available on board following the former request of the guest at least 30 days before the ship\u2019s departure. If we are notified outside this deadline, we will do everything in our power to provide the services requested, but this cannot be guaranteed at such short notice. 1.6.5 VEGETARIAN/ VEGAN MEALS Vegetarian and Vegan-friendly dishes are incorporated into our buffet and dining room culinary offerings. Our menu in the dining room includes always vegetarian and vegan options. 1.6.6 OTHER DIETARY REQUEST Guests who need to warm up baby formula or breast milk are referred to Room Service. For medical reasons or for infants, guests can specifically request some food to be blended onboard. Guests who for medical reasons wish to bring their own additives to the food served on board are directed to take care of mixing and dosing themselves for safety reasons. Following written approval from the Company, Guests can also bring their special sealed food on board. Products to be taken onboard should respect EU food labelling / packaging regulations and should not have an imminent expiry date. Once open they should be consumed as per instruction on the label. Our onboard staff are not authorized to store, cook or heat food items brought by guests.

The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person's disability. MSC welcomes service dogs on board its cruise vessels, provided they are in good health and in possession of all documents necessary for entry to the foreign countries visited during the cruise. For cruises including UK waters, the dog must be a full member of either Assistance Dogs International (ADI) or International Guide Dog Federation (IGDF) . Service dogs who are still in training, emotional support and companion animals are not recognized as assistance dogs, hence not allowed on MSC vessels. 1.8.2 SERVICE DOG ONBAORD A CRUISE SHIP MSC Cruises can provides a relief area with mulch but the guest, on his/her part, undertakes to be personally responsible for the custody, nutrition and general care of the animal throughout the period spent on board (with the help of a carer or fellow traveler if applicable) and for the possible damage caused by their service dog. If the service dog's behavior creates a fundamental alteration or a direct threat to safety, the dog may be denied boarding or removed from the ship along with the owner at the guest's expense. Service dogs are permitted to accompany the person with a disability in all public areas, including dining venues. While in public areas, dogs must be on a leash, harness, or other restraining device. Due to health regulations, service dogs are not permitted in recreational water facilities: pools, whirlpools, spray parks or Spa facilities. If the guest chooses to disembark the ship at a port at which the service dog must remain onboard, the guest must make arrangements to ensure that the dog is cared for. Note that the ship's staff are not available nor trained to care for the dog, nor can the dog be left in the cabin unattended. We do not offer the service of a vet on board and the ship's doctors are unable to assist. Due to the nature of some shore excursions, kindly note service animals may not be permitted. 1.8.3 SERVICE DOG\u2019S DOCUMENTATION It's the guest's responsibility to ensure that all documents related to the service dog are in compliance with all local regulations for each port of call of the itinerary and are submitted to the company at least 60 days prior to the start of the cruise. Please note that for the Worldcruise, documentation needs to be presented to the company at least 6 months prior to start the cruise as its special itinerary calls to more than 15 countries, and 50 ports, some of them very remote and with very strict bio-security requirements. Hard copies of the documents must be provided at embarkation and to Reception-Guest Service once onboard. Please be advised that in some ports of call the service dog might not be allowed to get off, according to local immigration rules. The documentation and immunization requirements are established by government authorities and not MSC Cruises. Please note requirements are subject to change without notice, and travel plans/certifications shall be shared with us to confirm compliance with all destinations Port Health Authorities, considering the departure/transit ports too. If any problem is experienced with the dog documentation upon entry in any port, all related costs for either the quarantine of or re-export of the dog will be the dog owner responsibility. Pet Passport and Third Country Certificates must be signed, dated and stamped by an Official Certified Veterinarian. Please be aware that obtaining those permits can take weeks or months, and some countries may not allow animals to enter at all. Copies of completed permits for each port of call must be sent to us as soon as available, prior to the sail date. Documentation that is required includes but not limited to: - A brief, written explanation of what specific tasks the animal has been trained to perform must be provided.

In addition, we offer twice daily clinics for routine medical needs. Our onboard medical facilities meet or exceed the standards for cruise ship medical centres adopted by CLIA and include some diagnostic and treatment abilities; however, the ship\u2019s medical centers do not have the same resources as a land-based hospital. They are staffed by full-time registered doctors and nurses, including paramedics on some ships. Their primary role is to provide emergency medical care and short-term treatment, rather than long-term nursing care. Guests unable to manage their daily personal care activities (feeding, bathing, dressing and toileting etc.) should travel with a caregiver who can assist with these tasks. Please be advised that the non-medical staff on board are not specifically trained to give daily care and are not able to assist guests with personal tasks or personal hygiene needs (eating, dressing, bathroom or bathing). 2.2 PREGNANCY For the health and safety of both mother and unborn child, MSC Cruises cannot accommodate guests who will be more than 23 weeks and 6 days pregnant at any time during the cruise .

This allows us to make the necessary checks and arrangements for your stay onboard. Regrettably we are unable to consider last-minute requests. Service animal requests need to be communicated at least 6 months before sailing date to allow checking with all different local authorities. Ports of call with a tender service may not be accessible for guests reliant on a wheelchair or scooter to travel or move around. Please feel free to request the list of ports with tender services before finalizing your booking. Mechanical ventilation and Peritoneal Dialysis are not available during the World cruise. Specific special diets including halal or kosher meals should be communicated at least 3 months before sailing . Please be reminded that during the Worldcruise, MSC Cruises will not accept guests who will be more than 23 weeks plus 6 days pregnant at any time during the cruise. For more information, please refer to the page here Internet What is satellite internet access and how does it work? When at sea, it is not possible to access the internet using a high-speed broadband connection as you would on land. Instead, internet connectivity on board is provided by links between the ship and communications satellites in orbit far above the Earth. Why is satellite internet access slower than a normal connection on land? Your internet data needs to travel vast distances between the ship's antennae and the nearest satellite, and it needs an unobstructed line of sight between them. A number of things may interfere with this, like storms and large objects that can block the signal, such as steep mountains close to the ship or tall buildings in ports. This interference can result in slow response times or even the system becoming unresponsive. Where is satellite internet access available on board? Satellite Internet Access is available in all public areas of the ship and in most cabins, including all MSC Yacht Club suites. All you need is one of our Satellite Internet Access packages and a mobile internet device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc.). What is the main difference between Browse and Browse & Stream packages? With the Browse & Stream package it is possible to use video calls, stream music and videos. Those cannot be used with the Browse package. For more information visit our dedicated website. When is the best/worst time to use satellite internet access? Congestion can make internet access slower, just as it would on land. It is therefore best to avoid these periods if possible. How much does each satellite internet access package cost? Packages are available either per day or for the duration of your cruise. The \"per cruise\" rate is based on the length of the cruise. To see prices for a specific cruise, go to the \"Wifi\" section of the website or consult the ship's network while on board. Is it possible to upgrade from the Browse package to the Browse & Stream one? Yes. You will be able to upgrade your package on board through the MSC Captive Portal (the website used to activate the pre-paid package). You can upgrade to a Browse package with additional devices or to the Browse & Stream package. You will only pay the difference between the full costs packages (to preserve the 20% discount advantage). Why is satellite internet access more expensive than a normal connection on land? Providing internet access on board via the ship's satellite connectivity involves significant investment in cutting-edge technology. The fees charged to those using the Satellite Internet Access service help cover the considerable costs of providing the service. Is the price for satellite internet access the same on every ship? No, on ships offering a premium service called Satellite Internet Plus, the rate is higher. Ships with this service include MSC Seaside, MSC Seaview, and MSC Splendida. Guests will experience faster speed and a better connection on these ships. Why does my internet connection cut off after [xx] minutes? When a user is logged on, updates and apps running in the background can increase traffic even when he/she is not actively using the internet. In order to reduce congestion and speed up internet access for active users, the system will automatically disconnect each user after XX minutes. To avoid being disconnected, you can return to this page before the XX minutes have elapsed and RESET the countdown. If you are automatically logged out by the system, you can reactivate your connection by simply clicking START. The package details include an allowance of mb per day/per cruise. What is a MB? MB stands for 'megabyte', which means 1 million bytes. It is a measure of the amount of information sent or received across an internet connection. For example, one photo upload to social media is approximately 5MB. Laundry Laundry packages Everyone loves the feel of freshly-laundered clothes and the convenience of a same-day laundry service. That's why we offer several Laundry Service Packages to choose from. Click here to discover more.

What is the best time to go on a Repositioning cruise? The best time to enjoy our repositioning cruises is ultimately down to personal preference, as MSC Grand Voyages are available all year round. When it comes to boarding a transatlantic cruise to hotter destinations, you may want to plan your departure to tie-in with less or more sunshine, again depending on your preferences. Travelling at different times of the year will always offer different benefits. Ultimately, a repositioning cruise in any month will make for an incredible holiday.

MSC Grand Voyages design each repositioning cruise with a range of budgets in mind, meaning that whatever you're planning on spending, there'll be a trip to suit you. Whether you're sticking to a strict budget or looking to enjoy more luxury, you'll have it all covered with a repositioning cruise. How long is a Repositioning cruise? Repositioning cruises are offered in a range of durations to provide maximum flexibility for guests. Embrace this flexibility by choosing a repositional or transatlantic cruise lasting anywhere between 10 and 30 days. This choice means that guests can use their time in a way that best suits them, balancing the journey between relaxing (or active) days onboard with various immersive excursions and port stops. What to pack for a repositioning cruise? When packing for repositioning cruises, there are a few essentials you should pack to ensure your trip with MSC Grand Voyages is as comfortable as it should be. During the day, casualwear is recommended alongside comfortable footwear. For excursions that may include visits to religious sites, it's advised to wear more modest garments that cover the knees and shoulders. Evenings are an opportunity to showcase smart, formal wear. Elegant shirts and dresses, tailored trousers and stylish shoes will all help to make gala nights and other occasions even more special - think black tie dress codes, tuxedoes and evening gowns. Consider packing a light jacket or jumper for cooler evenings and air-conditioned spaces onboard. If you're travelling through northern Europe or towards Polar regions, please pack adequate clothing, such as thermal layers, protective outerwear and appropriate footwear Do Repositioning cruises have entertainment? MSC Cruises' repositioning cruises offer world-class entertainment during every day of your travels, elevating your journey with creative pursuits, mindful practices and active classes, designed to accommodate all abilities and tastes. When evening draws in, enjoy live music performances and elaborate theatre showcases, ending your day of discovery with MSC Grand Voyages. What countries are included in a Repositioning cruise? Repositional cruises incorporate a huge selection of countries across multiple routes. Ancient history, iconic architecture, local cuisine and cultural experiences can all be uncovered on these trips. With MSC Grand Voyages, itineraries cover an impressive five continents, connecting you to locations as varied as Abu Dhabi, France, Antigua and Barbuda, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Egypt, Morocco, North America and numerous other desirable destinations, each rewarding in its own way Safety Safety on board A cruise isn\u2019t just one of the most luxurious and relaxing ways to see the world, it\u2019s also one of the safest. That\u2019s because every cruise ship has to be built, equipped and operated in accordance with the strict requirements of the international maritime treaty known as the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, developed by the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency responsible for shipping. As a result, for example, all cruise ships must have regularly-checked lifeboats, life rafts and life preservers for every person on board, plus a specified minimum additional capacity. The ultramodern ships in the MSC Cruises fleet go substantially above and beyond what is required, carrying backup mechanical, navigational and safety provisions. And of course our crews undertake extensive training and refresher training, certification and regular drills for emergency situations, including the evacuation of a ship. So you can cruise in peace with total peace of mind. Safety Security and Code of Conduct Before we depart, there will be a compulsory emergency drill (or briefing, if you embark in a secondary port) In accordance with the international Convention for the Safety Of Life At Sea (SOLAS), you are all required to take part in the emergency drill, where you will learn the correct way to put on your life-jacket and the procedures to follow in the event of an emergency. Children 0-12 years If you are travelling with infants or children under the age of 12 years, on embarkation they will be provided with an ID wristband which must be worn for the entire duration of the cruise. In the unlikely event of an emergency while your children are involved in children's club activities, our staff will escort them to the Children's Pick-up Area where they will wait for you to arrive and proceed with them to your Muster Station/Assembly Station. Security protection Guests are protected by a comprehensive system of security, such as the MSC Cruises Access Control and Screening System, which requires proof of identity to access with tickets and on a pre-approved list. Also all luggage must pass through strict check-points, cabins are protected by locks and individually equipped with safe boxes, public areas are monitored by cameras, and highly trained Ship Security Officers continuously patrol the ship and are on emergency call 24/7. Code of conduct We want every Guest to have a truly enjoyable cruise experience. Therefore, MSC Cruises does not tolerate any behaviour affecting the comfort, health, safety, and security of other Guests or our crew. Please refer to the contract conditions for more details on this important policy. You can find more information on our Guest Conduct Policy Here . How is Safety on board managed? All cruise ships are designed and operated in compliance with the strict requirements of the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that mandates global standards for the safety and operation of cruise ships through adoption of treaties, regulations and resolutions, codified in the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention. Safety-related regulations and requirements are rigorous - and ships often go substantially above and beyond what is required, for example carrying backup mechanical, navigational and safety provisions. Ships crews undertake extensive training, certification, drills and scenarios for emergency situations, including the evacuation of a ship. All cruise ships have lifeboats, life rafts and life preservers for every person on board as well as additional capacity. When and where are the drills held? Upon embarkation in the main ports, all guests are requested to participate in a one-hour safety drill conducted in the 6 languages. The Safety drills involve the entire crew and simulate the evacuation procedure, with guests requested to take their respective life jackets from their cabins and go to the assigned Muster Station where they receive additional safety instructions. In secondary ports, before the ship's departure, a detailed safety briefing is also held for all newly-embarked guests. The safety briefing is normally held in a dedicated area (usually the theatre or a Muster Station) and does not involve all the crew, being conducted by a group of social hostesses and animators that helps guests to familiarise themselves with the safety equipment and procedures. The Safety briefings and drills are all fully compliant with the strict SOLAS requirements. Are there any maps or other instructions? Safety instructions on how to reach the relevant muster station and where to find the respective life jackets are available in all cabins, in 6 languages (ITA, ENG, GER, FRA, SPA, PORT, RUS), in the cabin information booklet and behind the cabin door (in 6 languages), where fire instructions and a map are also displayed, showing \"You are here\" information and the primary and secondary escape routes to the muster stations. What other enhancements does the line use to ensure safety, i.e. maps showing routes to the nearest lifeboats, etc.? Maps on the location of the different muster stations are displayed in all public areas and staircases etc. All public areas also feature arrows showing the way to the muster stations and indicating the staircases to reach them. In addition, a safety video (in Italian and English) is broadcast 24/7 on the in-cabin television system on channel 1. How is our crew trained to operate the life boats? The crew receive regular training ashore, before embarkation and on board. The comprehensive on-board training coordinated by the ship's Safety Officer consists of 4 two-hour modules, as follows: A. Preliminary B. Emergency instructions C. Fire-fighting D. Life-saving A significant part of Section D is dedicated to management of the lifeboats. All crew members directly in charge of lifeboats receive additional and specific training on how to prepare, lower, pilot and maintain the lifeboats. How frequently is testing carried out in which the life boats are lowered? Every week the crew conduct a general emergency drill with fire simulation and evacuation, including an abandon ship drill with lifeboats. What are the industry regulations on fire safety on board or cruise ships? The cruise industry adheres to the rigid regulations contained in the International Convention for the Safety Of Life at Sea (SOLAS) as developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). These regulations include fire prevention, fire protection and extinguishing systems, crew training and fire emergency response. Whare measures are in place to prevent fires on board MSC cruises' ships? MSC ships have been designed to allow the isolation of fire and smoke and the MSC Cruises' fleet, like all cruise ships complying with industry standards, are equipped with a variety of passive fire-and smoke-fighting measures, including fire-rated interior doors and partitions, fire dampers and ventilation systems. Ships include smoke management systems with fire and smoke dampers and, in addition to fire doors, segregation of ventilation, and pressurized hallways to contain smoke and prevent it from spreading. Rules and regulations to prevent and to contain smoke and fire are in place and strictly followed on board all MSC cruise ships. The MSC Cruises' fleet uses several different systems for the prevention of fire. The main system for prevention is the Consilium System which consists of different types of detectors located throughout the ship and divided by the type of the area to be monitored. This prevention system is supported by Fire Patrol, a patrol operated by on board firemen 24 hours a day, in four hour shifts. The patrol is recorded by a digital system with several points located in various areas of the vessel. What systems are in place to control fires on board if they do break out? The MSC Cruises' fleet uses several different systems to control the spread of fire and smoke including fire-rated interior doors and partitions, fire dampers and ventilation systems. The main fire fighting system is the Hi-Fog, high-pressure water mist fire protection system, which suppresses and extinguishes fires by discharging a fine water mist at high velocity. The water mist is made by the system when it activates, pushing water at high pressure through specially designed, sprinkler and spray heads. Do the crew receive fire training? Crew members are extensively trained to ensure that they react effectively and appropriately in case of fire or smoke. In line with the Standards of Training, Certification & Watchkeeping (STCW) 1995, all crew must take Basic Safety Training (BST) - which includes basic firefighting. A fire drill is also carried out on board each MSC ship every week, in a different area of the ship. The emergency plan for controlling fire on board MSC vessels is executed by our four Fire Patrols, one of which is dedicated to engine room fires, and two cooling teams. All teams are trained and coordinated by the onboard Safety Officer.

MSC Cruises offers South Africa cruises during the winter season, from November to April, as this time of year is a fantastic time to visit the country. If you're a sun-seeker, the months of November to February are peak summer in the southern hemisphere, and an ideal time to hit the water and enjoy the continent's pristine beaches for your South Africa holidays. Cape Town, Durban, Mozambique and Mauritius come alive and offer a vibrant coastal experience. In March and April, milder weather begins to appear. This is also a good time to explore port towns and cities like Cape Town, Durban and Port Louis. Plus, these months may also offer quieter visits.

Whichever winter month you choose to visit, cruises to South Africa will be beautiful and MSC Cruises will make sure your experience is a memorable one. What is the weather like in South Africa?

Elsewhere, temperatures remain mild, but as the months progress, these drop. Winter brings cold winters to the interior, while the coastal areas like Durban remain relatively mild. Cape Town receives most of its rainfall during this period. Spring (September to November) returns to milder temperatures and offers less rain along the southern coast, making it an ideal time to travel there.

Coastal areas remain warm year-round, while the interior can cool off slightly during winter. Mauritius is a tropical island with a warm, humid climate most of the year. Summer is hot and humid with occasional cyclones, while winter is cooler and drier. Namibia is mostly dry with desert-like conditions. Summer brings occasional rainfall, but temperatures can soar.

Packing for a cruise to South Africa can seem to be full of choices, especially if you're unfamiliar with the weather. But knowing what to bring helps to ease the pressure, so that you can make the most of your holidays to South Africa. South Africa's weather varies depending on the season. If your cruise embarks from Durban and Cape Town, pack lightweight clothing for warm days, and a light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings. Your cruise may include time at beautiful beaches, and you may also have an opportunity to swim onboard - so don't forget to bring swimwear. A lightweight sarong or beach cover-up and sandals or flip-flops are also recommended. Pack a pair of comfortable walking shoes or sneakers. These are especially important if you plan to explore nature reserves on foot or head out on walking tours. You may also want to have a smarter pair of shoes and formal clothing for some onboard dinners and Gala Nights. South Africa enjoys plenty of sunshine, especially in the summer months. Sunscreen, sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat are essential, both for time onboard and while on excursions. What is the currency in the South Africa countries? South Africa uses the rand (ZAR), but ports of call in other countries may require cash payments in local currencies. Mozambique uses the Mozambican metical (MZN), Mauritius the Mauritian rupee (MUR) and Namibia uses the Namibian dollar (NAD). Many African countries also accept United States dollars, in some places.

South Africa, Mozambique and Namibia use South Africa Standard Time (SAST), or UTC+2. During UK winter (when the UK is on GMT), these countries are two hours ahead. During UK summer (when the UK is on BST), they will be one hour ahead. Mauritius is further east and uses Mauritius Time (MUT), or UTC+4. During UK winter, Mauritius is four hours ahead. During UK summer, Mauritius is three hours ahead. How long is a cruise to South Africa? South Africa cruises vary in length from three to 12 nights, depending on your chosen route. The shortest routes are between Durban and Portuguese Island and back, and Durban to Cape Town, which last three nights.

If you're exploring the country on an itinerary with MSC Cruises, your journey will showcase some of the very best aspects of this diverse country.

United States and Canada cruises When is the best time to cruise the US and Canada? Because North America offers something new in every season, there's never a bad time to holiday in the region. Because of this, North America cruises to the United States and Canada are available year-round with MSC Cruises. And while there'll always be plenty to see and do, autumn is seen as a particularly enjoyable time to embark on a United States cruise or a Canada cruise, thanks to fall foliage igniting in cities like Boston, New York and Quebec, all boasting spectacular displays of orange, red and yellow leaves. Meanwhile, an Alaska cruise with MSC Cruises is available between May and October, ensuring that guests experience optimum weather and wildlife viewing conditions. What is the weather like in the US and Canada? The weather in the United States and Canada is often comfortable, especially in the New England region and on Canada's east coast. On a United States cruise to ports like Boston and New York, guests might experience sunny days, with temperatures in the high 20s and low 30s (Celsius) during summer months, while spring and autumn welcome crisp, breezier days, with highs reaching single digit temperatures in Celsius. On a Canada cruise, cities like Quebec and Charlottetown experience pleasant and mild summers, with highs in the 20s (Celsius), while winter brings chillier temperatures and the possibility of snow. Alaska's weather is beautiful in the summer and early autumn months between May and October, with temperatures hovering between 10-20 degrees Celsius. Which ports do MSC Cruises visit in the US and Canada? Spend your North America holidays with MSC Cruises and visit thriving, exciting port cities in the United States and Canada, including New York, Galveston, San Diego and San Francisco. Other ports on a United States cruise may include Boston and Los Angeles. Those setting off on an Alaska cruise will need to embark from Seattle, with ports of call during an Alaska cruise including Ketchikan, Icy Strait/Hoonah, Tracy Arm, Juneau, Sitka and Victoria. When on a Canada cruise with MSC Cruises, some of the serene, nature-filled ports can include Halifax, Quebec, Sydney, Corner Brook, Charlottetown and Saint John. How much is a cruise to US and Canada? Great news: MSC Cruises offers a range of North America cruise options that can fit any budget. This means you can immerse yourself in bustling cityscapes or serene natural environments without fretting about costs. So, whatever you're dreaming about for your next holiday, rest assured that there'll be a North America cruise deal to fit in with your plans. Start planning your next well-earned trip now. What to pack for a cruise to US and Canada? On a United States cruise or a Canada cruise, it's a good idea to pack clothes suitable for both cooler and warmer temperatures. Think layers - add in a scarf and hat for later in the day when temperatures drop or pair your T-shirt with an overshirt to help out with any mildly chillier weather. If you're planning on enjoying any nature-based excursions during your holidays with MSC Cruises, it's essential to pack trainers, socks and breathable tops and trousers to ensure maximum comfort - perhaps when you're exploring the serene wilderness of Alaska or the misty mountains of Canada's eastern coast. It's also a good idea to pack a few smarter options for onboard your cruise, as these will fit in well with some of the more formal evening dinners and gala nights. What is the currency in the US and Canada? The currency in the United States is the US dollar (USD), while Canada uses the Canadian dollar (CAD). What is the time zone for the US and Canada? On your USA holidays, when visiting cities like New York and Boston on the East Coast, you'll be using Eastern Standard Time (EST). If you're embarking on an Alaska cruise from Seattle on the West Coast, you'll be in Pacific Standard Time (PST), which is three hours behind the East Coast. Most Alaskan cities (including the capital, Juneau) use Alaska Standard Time (AKST), which is one hour behind the West Coast. While visiting destinations on your Canada holidays, you will be in Eastern Standard Time in cities like Quebec, while Saint John, located in the New Brunswick province, along with Sydney and Halifax in Nova Scotia, are in Atlantic Daylight Time (ADT), or an hour ahead of Eastern Daylight time (EDT). Corner Brook in Newfoundland uses Newfoundland Standard Time (NT), which is 30 minutes ahead of Atlantic Standard Time (AST). How long is a cruise to US and Canada? Cruises to the United States and Canada usually range between six to 10 nights in length. Itineraries include routes from ever-energetic and attraction-packed New York to sun-kissed and beach-blessed Bermuda. Other itineraries feature the wild, untamed beauty of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, and New England - on the United States' East Coast - where it's easy to combine city charms with scenic sightseeing. Cruises to Alaska (embarking from Seattle) are seven-night trips, allowing you to get the most from this unique region over the course of a week. What are the best things to do in the US and Canada? On cruises in the United States and Canada, the best things to do put you up close and personal with riveting history and replete natural beauty - not to mention unforgettable shopping and dining experiences. Get to the heart of modern life in the United States by exploring bucket list-worthy attractions in New York. Soak up the energy of Times Square, gaze in wonder at the Statue of Liberty and get a poignant history lesson at the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration - and don't forget to explore the green oasis of Central Park. Boston is another must-see on any United States trip, not least due to its connections to key historical sites and monuments. Learn more by following the Freedom Trail or on a walking tour of the city's historic hotspots. A scenic cruise from Boston Harbour also comes highly recommended. Cruises to Canadian destinations boast seemingly endless views of natural wonders. Quebec is a great place to start appreciating Canada's nature-rich lands, through a visit to gorgeous rural towns like Lac-Beauport. Plus, from Quebec it's super-easy to access the immense Montmorency Falls. An Alaska cruise is a chance to stand and marvel at the glistening might of the Mendenhall Glacier - easily accessible from the Alaskan capital, Juneau, or to explore Alaskan culture in locations like colourful Ketchikan or via the thriving traditional crafts scene of Icy Strait and Hoonah.

That\u2019s because every cruise ship has to be built, equipped and operated in accordance with the strict requirements of the international maritime treaty known as the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, developed by the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency responsible for shipping. As a result, for example, all cruise ships must have regularly-checked lifeboats, life rafts and life preservers for every person on board, plus a specified minimum additional capacity. The ultramodern ships in the MSC Cruises fleet go substantially above and beyond what is required, carrying backup mechanical, navigational and safety provisions. And of course our crews undertake extensive training and refresher training, certification and regular drills for emergency situations, including the evacuation of a ship. So you can cruise in peace with total peace of mind. Safety Security and Code of Conduct Before we depart, there will be a compulsory emergency drill (or briefing, if you embark in a secondary port) In accordance with the international Convention for the Safety Of Life At Sea (SOLAS), you are all required to take part in the emergency drill, where you will learn the correct way to put on your life-jacket and the procedures to follow in the event of an emergency. Children 0-12 years If you are travelling with infants or children under the age of 12 years, on embarkation they will be provided with an ID wristband which must be worn for the entire duration of the cruise. In the unlikely event of an emergency while your children are involved in children's club activities, our staff will escort them to the Children's Pick-up Area where they will wait for you to arrive and proceed with them to your Muster Station/Assembly Station. Security protection Guests are protected by a comprehensive system of security, such as the MSC Cruises Access Control and Screening System, which requires proof of identity to access with tickets and on a pre-approved list. Also all luggage must pass through strict check-points, cabins are protected by locks and individually equipped with safe boxes, public areas are monitored by cameras, and highly trained Ship Security Officers continuously patrol the ship and are on emergency call 24/7. Code of conduct We want every Guest to have a truly enjoyable cruise experience. Therefore, MSC Cruises does not tolerate any behaviour affecting the comfort, health, safety, and security of other Guests or our crew. Please refer to the contract conditions for more details on this important policy. You can find more information on our Guest Conduct Policy Here . How is Safety on board managed? All cruise ships are designed and operated in compliance with the strict requirements of the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that mandates global standards for the safety and operation of cruise ships through adoption of treaties, regulations and resolutions, codified in the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention. Safety-related regulations and requirements are rigorous - and ships often go substantially above and beyond what is required, for example carrying backup mechanical, navigational and safety provisions. Ships crews undertake extensive training, certification, drills and scenarios for emergency situations, including the evacuation of a ship. All cruise ships have lifeboats, life rafts and life preservers for every person on board as well as additional capacity. When and where are the drills held? Upon embarkation in the main ports, all guests are requested to participate in a one-hour safety drill conducted in the 6 languages. The Safety drills involve the entire crew and simulate the evacuation procedure, with guests requested to take their respective life jackets from their cabins and go to the assigned Muster Station where they receive additional safety instructions. In secondary ports, before the ship's departure, a detailed safety briefing is also held for all newly-embarked guests. The safety briefing is normally held in a dedicated area (usually the theatre or a Muster Station) and does not involve all the crew, being conducted by a group of social hostesses and animators that helps guests to familiarise themselves with the safety equipment and procedures. The Safety briefings and drills are all fully compliant with the strict SOLAS requirements. Are there any maps or other instructions? Safety instructions on how to reach the relevant muster station and where to find the respective life jackets are available in all cabins, in 6 languages (ITA, ENG, GER, FRA, SPA, PORT, RUS), in the cabin information booklet and behind the cabin door (in 6 languages), where fire instructions and a map are also displayed, showing \"You are here\" information and the primary and secondary escape routes to the muster stations. What other enhancements does the line use to ensure safety, i.e. maps showing routes to the nearest lifeboats, etc.? Maps on the location of the different muster stations are displayed in all public areas and staircases etc. All public areas also feature arrows showing the way to the muster stations and indicating the staircases to reach them. In addition, a safety video (in Italian and English) is broadcast 24/7 on the in-cabin television system on channel 1. How is our crew trained to operate the life boats? The crew receive regular training ashore, before embarkation and on board. The comprehensive on-board training coordinated by the ship's Safety Officer consists of 4 two-hour modules, as follows: A. Preliminary B. Emergency instructions C. Fire-fighting D. Life-saving A significant part of Section D is dedicated to management of the lifeboats. All crew members directly in charge of lifeboats receive additional and specific training on how to prepare, lower, pilot and maintain the lifeboats. How frequently is testing carried out in which the life boats are lowered? Every week the crew conduct a general emergency drill with fire simulation and evacuation, including an abandon ship drill with lifeboats. What are the industry regulations on fire safety on board or cruise ships? The cruise industry adheres to the rigid regulations contained in the International Convention for the Safety Of Life at Sea (SOLAS) as developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). These regulations include fire prevention, fire protection and extinguishing systems, crew training and fire emergency response. Whare measures are in place to prevent fires on board MSC cruises' ships? MSC ships have been designed to allow the isolation of fire and smoke and the MSC Cruises' fleet, like all cruise ships complying with industry standards, are equipped with a variety of passive fire-and smoke-fighting measures, including fire-rated interior doors and partitions, fire dampers and ventilation systems. Ships include smoke management systems with fire and smoke dampers and, in addition to fire doors, segregation of ventilation, and pressurized hallways to contain smoke and prevent it from spreading. Rules and regulations to prevent and to contain smoke and fire are in place and strictly followed on board all MSC cruise ships. The MSC Cruises' fleet uses several different systems for the prevention of fire. The main system for prevention is the Consilium System which consists of different types of detectors located throughout the ship and divided by the type of the area to be monitored. This prevention system is supported by Fire Patrol, a patrol operated by on board firemen 24 hours a day, in four hour shifts. The patrol is recorded by a digital system with several points located in various areas of the vessel. What systems are in place to control fires on board if they do break out? The MSC Cruises' fleet uses several different systems to control the spread of fire and smoke including fire-rated interior doors and partitions, fire dampers and ventilation systems. The main fire fighting system is the Hi-Fog, high-pressure water mist fire protection system, which suppresses and extinguishes fires by discharging a fine water mist at high velocity. The water mist is made by the system when it activates, pushing water at high pressure through specially designed, sprinkler and spray heads. Do the crew receive fire training? Crew members are extensively trained to ensure that they react effectively and appropriately in case of fire or smoke. In line with the Standards of Training, Certification & Watchkeeping (STCW) 1995, all crew must take Basic Safety Training (BST) - which includes basic firefighting. A fire drill is also carried out on board each MSC ship every week, in a different area of the ship. The emergency plan for controlling fire on board MSC vessels is executed by our four Fire Patrols, one of which is dedicated to engine room fires, and two cooling teams. All teams are trained and coordinated by the onboard Safety Officer.

MSC Cruises offers South Africa cruises during the winter season, from November to April, as this time of year is a fantastic time to visit the country. If you're a sun-seeker, the months of November to February are peak summer in the southern hemisphere, and an ideal time to hit the water and enjoy the continent's pristine beaches for your South Africa holidays. Cape Town, Durban, Mozambique and Mauritius come alive and offer a vibrant coastal experience. In March and April, milder weather begins to appear. This is also a good time to explore port towns and cities like Cape Town, Durban and Port Louis. Plus, these months may also offer quieter visits. MSC Cruises' winter trips offer an amazing onboard experience that will keep you warm and thoroughly entertained if the weather turns. Whichever winter month you choose to visit, cruises to South Africa will be beautiful and MSC Cruises will make sure your experience is a memorable one. What is the weather like in South Africa? South Africa has a diverse climate, with summer from December to February and winter from June to August. With some exceptions, the country generally experiences moderate weather systems, making cruises to South Africa enjoyable from November to April. During summer, coastal regions are generally hot and dry, while the interior experiences sporadic afternoon thunderstorms. Autumn (March to May) brings milder temperatures, and cities in the southwest, like Cape Town, may start to experience their first rainfalls. Elsewhere, temperatures remain mild, but as the months progress, these drop. Winter brings cold winters to the interior, while the coastal areas like Durban remain relatively mild. Cape Town receives most of its rainfall during this period. Spring (September to November) returns to milder temperatures and offers less rain along the southern coast, making it an ideal time to travel there. Neighbouring Mozambique is a tropical country that experiences a hot, rainy season from November to March, followed by a dry, cooler season from April to October. Coastal areas remain warm year-round, while the interior can cool off slightly during winter. Mauritius is a tropical island with a warm, humid climate most of the year. Summer is hot and humid with occasional cyclones, while winter is cooler and drier. Namibia is mostly dry with desert-like conditions. Summer brings occasional rainfall, but temperatures can soar. Winter is dry, with cold nights and warm days. Which ports do MSC Cruises visit in South Africa? Durban and Cape Town are South Africa's primary cruise ports and embarkation points for all South Africa cruises. Your specific embarkation port will depend on your journey. Durban and Cape Town have modern, efficient facilities that are perfect for starting your South Africa holidays and for exploring Africa's west or east coast. MSC Cruises has several other ports of call along the African coastline, from Namibia to Mozambique and Mauritius. Which port your cruise calls at will depend on your itinerary. Some other ports from the many varied options available include: Pomene in Mozambique, Port Louis in Mauritius, Walvis Bay in Namibia and La Possession in R\u00e9union. How much is a cruise to South Africa? Whatever budget you've allocated for your South Africa cruises, MSC Cruises can provide you with the ideal getaway. Cruise prices vary depending on the length of the itinerary - for example, four-night cruises offer a budget-friendly choice, while still providing a fantastic introduction to a destination. Meanwhile, longer cruises are ideal for those wanting to really get to grips with a location. Whatever option you're leaning towards, our South Africa cruise deals will help deliver your dream cruise. What to pack for a cruise to South Africa? Packing for a cruise to South Africa can seem to be full of choices, especially if you're unfamiliar with the weather. But knowing what to bring helps to ease the pressure, so that you can make the most of your holidays to South Africa. South Africa's weather varies depending on the season. If your cruise embarks from Durban and Cape Town, pack lightweight clothing for warm days, and a light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings. Your cruise may include time at beautiful beaches, and you may also have an opportunity to swim onboard - so don't forget to bring swimwear. A lightweight sarong or beach cover-up and sandals or flip-flops are also recommended. Pack a pair of comfortable walking shoes or sneakers. These are especially important if you plan to explore nature reserves on foot or head out on walking tours. You may also want to have a smarter pair of shoes and formal clothing for some onboard dinners and Gala Nights. South Africa enjoys plenty of sunshine, especially in the summer months. Sunscreen, sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat are essential, both for time onboard and while on excursions. What is the currency in the South Africa countries? South Africa uses the rand (ZAR), but ports of call in other countries may require cash payments in local currencies. Mozambique uses the Mozambican metical (MZN), Mauritius the Mauritian rupee (MUR) and Namibia uses the Namibian dollar (NAD). Many African countries also accept United States dollars, in some places. What is the time zone in South Africa countries? Keeping track of your time zones while on your South Africa holiday is important if you intend to stay in touch with friends and family back home. South Africa, Mozambique and Namibia use South Africa Standard Time (SAST), or UTC+2. During UK winter (when the UK is on GMT), these countries are two hours ahead. During UK summer (when the UK is on BST), they will be one hour ahead. Mauritius is further east and uses Mauritius Time (MUT), or UTC+4. During UK winter, Mauritius is four hours ahead. During UK summer, Mauritius is three hours ahead. How long is a cruise to South Africa? South Africa cruises vary in length from three to 12 nights, depending on your chosen route. The shortest routes are between Durban and Portuguese Island and back, and Durban to Cape Town, which last three nights. Itineraries to Durban to Pomene and back, and from Cape Town to Walvis Bay and back, both last four nights. Slightly longer is an itinerary from Durban to Pomene and Portuguese Island and back, lasting six nights. The longest of MSC Cruises' offerings in South Africa is a 12-night journey from Durban to Mauritius and back. What countries are part of a South Africa cruise? South Africa is your main destination when embarking on South Africa cruises, but journeys can also include stops at other neighbouring nations and nearby destinations. Where you visit also depends on which itinerary you select for your South Africa holidays. MSC Cruises offers a popular cruise up South Africa's west coast towards Namibia. Or travel with us up South Africa's east coast to Mozambique, or the Indian Ocean island nation Mauritius. Other island nations like R\u00e9union and Madagascar often form part of South African cruise itineraries, with many trips to the country's east including visits to at least one - but often more - neighbouring nations. What are the best things to do in South Africa? Cruises to South Africa offer unforgettable experiences, often set to scenically spectacular landscapes. If you're exploring the country on an itinerary with MSC Cruises, your journey will showcase some of the very best aspects of this diverse country.

Durban presents an entirely different list of must-see attractions. Walk the historic Victoria Street Market, where the scents of spices that helped establish the city still fill the air. Durban's Botanical Gardens offers a more peaceful retreat among rare plant species. Or head inland on an excursion to the Valley of a Thousand Hills.

Please click hereopens in a new tab to verify the required travel documents and visas for your entire cruise and ensure you have them available when needed. What is the difference between E-ticket and Boarding pass? To board our cruises, you only need one of the following documents: an E-ticket or Boarding Pass. - E-ticket: An e-ticket is an electronic ticket that provides a summary of all booked services, information about the itinerary, luggage labels, and other useful details for going on your MSC Cruise. - Boarding Pass: The boarding pass is an online document issued only to customers who book directly from the website and complete the web check-in. It includes a QR code scanned at boarding. How can I get my e-tickets or boarding pass? If you booked through our website and completed the web check-in, at the end of the web check-in process, you will be able to request via E-mail the E-ticket and download the Boarding pass. If you have booked via a travel agency you can request your tickets directly from your travel agent. When should I do the Web Check-In? Web check-in is available from 30 days to 24 hours before departure. We recommend completing your web check-in as early as possible to ensure you receive your E-ticket and Boarding pass promptly. What data do I need to enter in the Web Check-In? Please note that all fields with an asterisk (*) are mandatory. When you enter your postcode and click \"Search postcode,\" the \"Region and District\" field in your address information will be filled in automatically. Security photo and credit card registration are not mandatory for obtaining your E-ticket and Boarding pass . However, we recommend them to expedite your embarkation process. How do I take the security photo? A device with a camera is required to create the security photo, for example a smartphone or laptop with a camera. The photo is taken automatically as soon as all the necessary requirements such as brightness and positioning of the face are met. It is not possible to upload the photo locally. - I am having difficulty with uploading the security photo, what do I do? If it is not possible to take a photo, this will be taken by MSC staff upon embarkation. The security photo is used for identification during embarkation and disembarkation in the ports. Do I have to register my credit card during the Web Check-in? No, you can register your credit card on board at the Activation Points or leave a cash deposit with Guest Services at reception immediately after embarkation. Please make sure that your credit or debit card can be used abroad. Why should I register my credit card during the Web Check-in? All purchases made on board are paid for with your personal Cruise Card. You therefore do not need to have any cash or credit cards with you on board. If you have already registered your credit card during web check-in, you do not need to register your means of payment on board. Can I change or delete my credit card details after entering them in Web Check-In? You can only register a credit card for yourself or other guests included in your booking. Once registered, credit card details cannot be changed, corrected, or cancelled before departure. Please contact Guest Services directly on board if any changes are needed. What is the Emergency Contact and which details should I enter in this section during the web check-in? An emergency contact is a person you designate to be contacted in case of an emergency during your cruise; in this section you should provide the name, surname, and phone number of a contact person, such as a relative or friend. What if I cannot save my data? If possible, please change the device you are using (e.g., laptop instead of smartphone). Please ensure that you are using the latest browser version. Delete your cookies and cache if necessary. What information do I need to know about the embarkation time? MSC Cruises will assign you a specific check-in slot by default. - Can I change my check in slot? Please note that it is only possible to change the embarkation time during web check in accessible from 30 days before departure by the lead guest only. If only the assigned arrival time will be available, It is then not possible to change the check-in slot - What happens if I arrive earlier than my allocated check in slot? If you arrive before your dedicated check-in slot opens you may be requested to wait outside of the terminal building. - What happens if I arrive later than my allocated check in slot? In the event you arrive after your dedicated check-in slot closes you may be denied embarkation. - Where can I find information about the ship's arrival and departure time? The ship's departure and arrival times shown on your ticket or in the MSC for ME app are estimated and might differ from those indicated, which is why it is essential you adhere to your check-in slot. How can I connect my reservation to another one to share the same dinner table? To request shared dining with friends or family, enter their booking number in the Travel With section during the web check-in. Please note that shared dining is subject to availability. United States and Canada cruises When is the best time to cruise the US and Canada? Because North America offers something new in every season, there's never a bad time to holiday in the region. Because of this, North America cruises to the United States and Canada are available year-round with MSC Cruises. And while there'll always be plenty to see and do, autumn is seen as a particularly enjoyable time to embark on a United States cruise or a Canada cruise, thanks to fall foliage igniting in cities like Boston, New York and Quebec, all boasting spectacular displays of orange, red and yellow leaves. Meanwhile, an Alaska cruise with MSC Cruises is available between May and October, ensuring that guests experience optimum weather and wildlife viewing conditions. What is the weather like in the US and Canada? The weather in the United States and Canada is often comfortable, especially in the New England region and on Canada's east coast. On a United States cruise to ports like Boston and New York, guests might experience sunny days, with temperatures in the high 20s and low 30s (Celsius) during summer months, while spring and autumn welcome crisp, breezier days, with highs reaching single digit temperatures in Celsius. On a Canada cruise, cities like Quebec and Charlottetown experience pleasant and mild summers, with highs in the 20s (Celsius), while winter brings chillier temperatures and the possibility of snow. Alaska's weather is beautiful in the summer and early autumn months between May and October, with temperatures hovering between 10-20 degrees Celsius. Which ports do MSC Cruises visit in the US and Canada? Spend your North America holidays with MSC Cruises and visit thriving, exciting port cities in the United States and Canada, including New York, Galveston, San Diego and San Francisco. Other ports on a United States cruise may include Boston and Los Angeles. Those setting off on an Alaska cruise will need to embark from Seattle, with ports of call during an Alaska cruise including Ketchikan, Icy Strait/Hoonah, Tracy Arm, Juneau, Sitka and Victoria. When on a Canada cruise with MSC Cruises, some of the serene, nature-filled ports can include Halifax, Quebec, Sydney, Corner Brook, Charlottetown and Saint John. How much is a cruise to US and Canada? Great news: MSC Cruises offers a range of North America cruise options that can fit any budget. This means you can immerse yourself in bustling cityscapes or serene natural environments without fretting about costs. So, whatever you're dreaming about for your next holiday, rest assured that there'll be a North America cruise deal to fit in with your plans. Start planning your next well-earned trip now. What to pack for a cruise to US and Canada? On a United States cruise or a Canada cruise, it's a good idea to pack clothes suitable for both cooler and warmer temperatures. Think layers - add in a scarf and hat for later in the day when temperatures drop or pair your T-shirt with an overshirt to help out with any mildly chillier weather. If you're planning on enjoying any nature-based excursions during your holidays with MSC Cruises, it's essential to pack trainers, socks and breathable tops and trousers to ensure maximum comfort - perhaps when you're exploring the serene wilderness of Alaska or the misty mountains of Canada's eastern coast. It's also a good idea to pack a few smarter options for onboard your cruise, as these will fit in well with some of the more formal evening dinners and gala nights. What is the currency in the US and Canada? The currency in the United States is the US dollar (USD), while Canada uses the Canadian dollar (CAD). What is the time zone for the US and Canada? On your USA holidays, when visiting cities like New York and Boston on the East Coast, you'll be using Eastern Standard Time (EST). If you're embarking on an Alaska cruise from Seattle on the West Coast, you'll be in Pacific Standard Time (PST), which is three hours behind the East Coast. Most Alaskan cities (including the capital, Juneau) use Alaska Standard Time (AKST), which is one hour behind the West Coast. While visiting destinations on your Canada holidays, you will be in Eastern Standard Time in cities like Quebec, while Saint John, located in the New Brunswick province, along with Sydney and Halifax in Nova Scotia, are in Atlantic Daylight Time (ADT), or an hour ahead of Eastern Daylight time (EDT). Corner Brook in Newfoundland uses Newfoundland Standard Time (NT), which is 30 minutes ahead of Atlantic Standard Time (AST). How long is a cruise to US and Canada? Cruises to the United States and Canada usually range between six to 10 nights in length. Itineraries include routes from ever-energetic and attraction-packed New York to sun-kissed and beach-blessed Bermuda. Other itineraries feature the wild, untamed beauty of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, and New England - on the United States' East Coast - where it's easy to combine city charms with scenic sightseeing. Cruises to Alaska (embarking from Seattle) are seven-night trips, allowing you to get the most from this unique region over the course of a week. What are the best things to do in the US and Canada? On cruises in the United States and Canada, the best things to do put you up close and personal with riveting history and replete natural beauty - not to mention unforgettable shopping and dining experiences. Get to the heart of modern life in the United States by exploring bucket list-worthy attractions in New York. Soak up the energy of Times Square, gaze in wonder at the Statue of Liberty and get a poignant history lesson at the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration - and don't forget to explore the green oasis of Central Park. Boston is another must-see on any United States trip, not least due to its connections to key historical sites and monuments. Learn more by following the Freedom Trail or on a walking tour of the city's historic hotspots. A scenic cruise from Boston Harbour also comes highly recommended. Cruises to Canadian destinations boast seemingly endless views of natural wonders. Quebec is a great place to start appreciating Canada's nature-rich lands, through a visit to gorgeous rural towns like Lac-Beauport. Plus, from Quebec it's super-easy to access the immense Montmorency Falls. An Alaska cruise is a chance to stand and marvel at the glistening might of the Mendenhall Glacier - easily accessible from the Alaskan capital, Juneau, or to explore Alaskan culture in locations like colourful Ketchikan or via the thriving traditional crafts scene of Icy Strait and Hoonah.

Our reputation for trust and integrity relies also upon every action by every employee every day and in order to ensure this is embraced across the organization, we have a comprehensive Code of Ethical Business Conduct in place. Fostering an Ethical Corporate Culture The MSC Cruises\u2019 Code of Conduct for its employees is a guideline to help all employees run their part of the business ethically, both ashore as well as on our ships, and aims at ensuring that business practices comply with applicable laws, regulations and ethical business principles, as well as upholding a culture of integrity . While our Code sets forth a common standard of approved behaviour, regardless of the location of the employee, these standards are a complement to applicable laws and regulations in many countries where MSC Cruises operates and often exceed local or international standards. All our onshore or shipboard employees are required to adhere to the Code. We are committed to making sure the Code of Ethical Business Conduct is respected. Read more Read less Our 9 areas of focus While our Code of Conduct for our employees provides a meaningful starting point, it may not answer all questions, or ensure compliance with the various legal requirements applicable to its business and environment. Therefore, we have defined 9 critical areas where we aim to heighten sensitivity among all staff and install a strong culture of compliance and integrity. All these areas are featured in our Code of Conduct for employees. Our areas of focus include: 1. Respect for the environment 2. Human rights and labour standards 3. Anti-bribery 4. Conflict of interest 5. Sanctions regulations 6. Anti-money laundering 7. Fair competition 8. Accuracy and maintenance of business and financial records 9.

Our Compliance Organization may conduct confidential interviews with employees, contractors, or anybody they feel is relevant to the investigation. As a general practice, it takes around 60 days for an investigation to be concluded. However, we may need more time for complex matters. 5. You'll receive a reply After reviewing all the findings of the investigation, we'll decide if any further action needs to be taken. When appropriate, we'll keep you informed of progress and will send you a final reply outlining the outcome of the investigation. MSC Cruises prohibits any retaliation against an employee, individual or entity who has made a report. We'll also protect the rights of any implicated person. "
